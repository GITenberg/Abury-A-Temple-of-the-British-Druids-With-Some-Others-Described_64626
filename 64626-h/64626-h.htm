  </div>

  <p class="smcap small">Right Honourable,</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN a family that has been in all ages remarkably the friend of the
    muses, I think myself happy, that I have a particular claim. To You,
    my Lord, this dedication is devolv‚Äôd by hereditary right. Through Your
    father‚Äôs auspices and encouragement, I began and continued the work. He
    was ever pleas‚Äôd to look upon my mean performances with a favourable
    eye; and to assist me out of the inexhaustible fund of his own
    knowledge, in all kinds of ancient learning; and promised to patronize
    it, when published.</p>

  <p>But if any thing herein be acceptable to the publick, they are indebted
    to Your Lordship for its appearing abroad sooner than I intended
    myself. Out of that innate love of letters which warms the breast of
    the <span class="smcap">Pembrokes</span>, You thought fit to prompt and encourage me to
    the printing of it; and Your Lordship‚Äôs judgment will be an agreeable
    prejudice in my favour; who have cultivated Your excellent talents by
    your own industry; by all that can be learn‚Äôd in a curious view and
    observation of the antiquities of <i>Italy</i>; who are in every sense
    a master of that immense treasure of <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i>
    marbles, which render <i>Wilton</i> the <i>Tramontane Rome</i>.</p>

  <p>Besides that learning which is the ornament of the present age, Your
    Lordship knows how to put a true value on the antiquities proper
    to Your own country. If they want somewhat of the delicacy of the
    <i>Augustan</i> times, or that of <i>Alexander</i> the great; yet they
    have their beauties, and even elegancies, which affect so exquisite a
    taste as Your Lordship‚Äôs. A symmetry and harmony of parts, an amazing
    grandeur in the design, the incredible force of the mechanick powers
    employ‚Äôd in them, the most magnificent effect produc‚Äôd, will for
    ever recommend the works of the Druids, to those of Your Lordship‚Äôs
    discerning eye and accurate judgment.  </p>

  <p>We see a convincing demonstration of this, in the fine and costly model
    of <i>Stonehenge</i>, which Your Lordship introduces in the garden
    at <i>Wilton</i>; where, I may be bold to say, it shines amidst the
    splendours of <i>Inigo Jones</i>‚Äôs architecture; amidst what he did
    there in person, and what Your Lordship has since added, so agreeable
    to the former, as to render the design of that great genius complete.</p>

  <p>So uncommon and unconfin‚Äôd is Your Lordship‚Äôs knowledge in
    architecture, particularly, that <i>Great Britain</i> beholds a bridge
    arising, chiefly under Your direction, superior to any the <i>Roman</i>
    power produc‚Äôd at the height of empire. And <i>Thames</i>, which so
    lately rescu‚Äôd the <i>Danube</i> from <i>gallic</i> tyranny, boasts
    of a nobler ornament than that which <i>Trajan</i> built across that
    famous river.</p>

  <p>That commendable ardour of mind, which in Your younger years led you
    to study men and manners, places and things, in foreign countries,
    you now employ for the good of Your own; in the exercise of civil and
    military arts. Your Lordship tempers that love of liberty, which is
    the glory of government, with that just allegiance to the sovereign,
    which is the security of all; so as to give us a view of that amiable
    character of ancient <i>english</i> nobility, which adorns every page
    of <i>british</i> history. Permit me the honour to profess myself</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">HISTORY is political wisdom, philosophy is religious. The one consists
    in the knowledge of memorable things, and application of that knowledge
    to the good conduct of life: in embracing the good, and avoiding the
    ill consequences and examples of actions. So the other teaches us to
    entertain worthy notions of the supreme being, and the studying to
    obtain his favour: which is the end of all human and divine wisdom.
    Religion is the means to arrive at this purpose. In order to be
    satisfied what is true religion, we must go up to the fountain-head as
    much as possible. The first religion undoubtedly is true, as coming
    immediately from God.</p>

  <p>When I first began these studies about the Druid antiquities, I plainly
    discern‚Äôd, the religion profess‚Äôd in these places was the first,
    simple, patriarchal religion. Which made me judge it worth while to
    prosecute my enquiries about them, as a matter the most interesting
    and important. Knowledge is the glory of a man, divine knowledge of a
    christian. What I have done in this volume, is a further prosecution of
    the scheme I have laid down to this purpose. The noble person to whom
    it is dedicated, induc‚Äôd me to hasten the publication, suggesting the
    shortness of human life, and having a good opinion of the work.</p>

  <p>I was willing to lay hold on the first opportunity of communicating to
    the world, the pleasure of contemplating so very noble antiquities,
    which we enjoy in our own island, before it be too late to see them. My
    endeavour in it is to open the times of first planting the world, after
    the flood; the propagation of true religion together with mankind; the
    deviation into idolatry; the persons that built the several kinds
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">ii</span>of
    patriarchal temples, such as we see here, in the more eastern parts of
    the world; the planters of <i>Great Britain</i> in particular; and the
    connexion there is between the east and west in matters of religion.
    All this shews there was but one religion at first, pure and simple.</p>

  <p><i>Pausanias in Corinthiac.</i> writes, ‚Äúthe <i>Phliasians</i>, one of
    the most ancient colonies in <i>Greece</i>, had a very holy temple, in
    which there was no image, either openly to be seen, or kept in secret.‚Äù
    He mentions the like of a grove or temple of <i>Hebe</i>, belonging to
    that people; and adds, ‚Äúthey give a mystical reason for it.‚Äù I guess
    the mystery to be, that it was after the first and patriarchal manner.
    The same author says <i>in argol.</i> ‚Äúthat at <i>Prona</i> is a temple
    of <i>Vesta</i>, no image, but an altar, on which they sacrifice.‚Äù The
    ancient <i>Hetruscans</i> ordain‚Äôd by a law, that there should be no
    statue in their temples. <i>Lucian de dea Syr.</i> writes, ‚Äúthe ancient
    temples in <i>Egypt</i> had no statues.‚Äù <i>Plutarch, in Numa</i>, and
    <i>Clemens Alexan. strom.</i> I. remark, ‚Äúthat <i>Numa</i> the second
    king of <i>Rome</i>, made express orders against the use of images, in
    the worship of the deity.‚Äù <i>Plutarch</i> adds, ‚Äúthat for the first
    170 years after building the city, the <i>Romans</i> used no images,
    but thought the deity to be invisible.‚Äù So to the days of <i>Silius
    Italicus</i> and <i>Philostratus</i>, at the temple of <i>Hercules</i>
    our planter of <i>Britain</i>, at <i>Gades</i>, the old patriarchal
    method of religion was observ‚Äôd, as bishop <i>Cumberland</i> takes
    notice, <i>Sanchoniathon</i>, p. 266.</p>

  <p class="noindent">And our <i>british</i> Druids had no images. And whatever we find in
    history, that looks like idolatry in them, is not to be referr‚Äôd to the
    aboriginal Druids, but to the later colonies from the continent.</p>

  <p>Likewise I have open‚Äôd a large communication between the patriarchal
    family, of <i>Abraham</i> particularly, and of the first planters of
    the coasts on the ocean of <i>Spain</i>, <i>Gaul</i>, <i>Germany</i>
    and <i>Britain</i>. ‚ÄôTis plain, what religion was here first planted,
    as being an almost inaccessible island, flourished exceedingly, and
    kept up to its original system, even to the days of <i>C√¶sar</i>,
    I mean among the aboriginal inhabitants. The new planters from the
    continent, on the southern and eastern shore of the island, were
    tinctured at least with idolatry, in the later
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">iii</span> times. Whilst on the
    continent, where more frequent changes of inhabitants happen, idolatry
    every where polluted it. But in all accounts of the first beginnings
    of nations, they had the first religion: ‚Äôtill as every where, time,
    riches, politeness and prosperity bring on corruption in church and
    state.</p>

  <p>We find, on the continent, idolatry crept on by degrees universally,
    which was the occasion of providence exerting its self in the
    <i>Mosaick</i> dispensation: and thereby changing the manner of these
    temples, altogether polluted. Nevertheless we have no reason to think
    but that the Druids, in this island of ours, generally kept up to
    the purity of their first and patriarchal institution. And that is
    the reason that all our classical writers, tho‚Äô much later than the
    times we are treating of, represent them as a people of a religion
    diametrically opposite to that of the rest of the world, even as the
    <i>Jews</i> then, or christians afterwards.</p>

  <p>Therefore I thought it fully worth while, to bestow some pains on
    these temples of theirs, as the only monuments we have left, of the
    patriarchal religion; and especially in regard to their extraordinary
    grandeur and magnificence, equal to any of the most noted wonders of
    the world, as commonly termed.</p>

  <p>I have shewn largely enough, the evidences that there were such kinds
    of temples built all the world over, in the first times; but probably
    nothing of them now remaining, comparable to those in our own island:
    which therefore we ought to seek to rescue from oblivion, before it be
    too late.</p>

  <p>I propose to publish but one volume more to complete this argument,
    as far as I have materials for that purpose. What I have done, I
    look upon as very imperfect, and but as opening the scene of this
    very noble subject. The curious will find sufficient room to extend
    it, to correct and adorn the plan I have begun. And I take it to be
    well worthy of the pains; as it lets in upon us an excellent view of
    the scheme of providence, in conducting the affair of true religion,
    thro‚Äô the several ages of the world. We may hence discern the great
    purpose of inducing the <i>Mosaick</i> dispensation, on that very spot
    of ground where the main of idolatry began, and from whence it was
    propagated over all the western and politer world; and over which world
    providence rais‚Äôd the mighty <i>Roman</i> empire, to pave the way of a
    republication of the patriarchal religion.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span></p>

  <p>We may make this general reflexion from the present work, that the true
    religion has chiefly since the repeopling mankind after the flood,
    subsisted in our island: and here we made the best reformation from the
    universal pollution of christianity, popery. Here God‚Äôs ancient people
    the <i>Jews</i> are in the easiest situation, any where upon earth;
    and from hence most likely to meet with that conversion designed them.
    And could we but reform from the abominable publick profanation of the
    sabbath and common swearing, we might hope for what many learned men
    have thought; that here was to be open‚Äôd the glory of Christ‚Äôs kingdom
    on earth.</p>

  <p>I have render‚Äôd it sufficiently clear, that the <i>Apollo</i> of the
    ancients was really <i>Phut</i> son of <i>Cham</i>. And I have pointed
    to the reader, how he may have a perfect idea of the countenance of
    the man, in innumerable monuments of antiquity, now to be seen. I have
    pursued that amusing topick thro‚Äô very many of the ancient patriarchs
    before and after <i>Phut</i>: so as to recover their, at least
    heroical, effigies. Which, I hope, sometime I may find an opportunity
    of publishing.</p>

  <p>I shall conclude my preface with a piece of old poetry, being some
    nervous lines, in no contemptible vein, wrote on our subject a hundred
    years ago, by <i>Samuel Danyel</i> a domestick of queen <i>Anne‚Äôs</i>,
    wife to king <i>James</i> I. The curious reader will observe a
    remarkable delicacy in the sentiments throughout: a struggle between
    time and the greatness of these works, equal to that of letters, in
    endeavouring to recover and preserve the memory of them; which their
    founders, tho‚Äô well qualified, neglected to do.</p>

    <i>Of the origin of Druid or patriarchal temples, with publick
    religion and celebration of the sabbath. They were made of rude
    stones set upright in the ground, round in form, and open. In
    hot countries, groves were planted about them.</i> Abraham
    <i>practised it, and from him our Druids. Of the quality of
    evidence, in matters of such antiquity. The patriarchs had a
    knowledge of the nature of the Deity to be ador‚Äôd, subsisting
    in distinct personalities: which is even deducible from human
    reason. The Druids had the same knowledge, as appears by their
    works. The first publick practice of religion was called,
    invoking in the name of</i> Jehovah, <i>the mediator.</i>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">THE</span> writers on antiquities generally find more difficulty, in so
    handling the matter, as to render it agreeable to the reader, than in
    most other subjects. Tediousness in any thing is a fault, more so in
    this than other sciences. ‚ÄôTis an offence, if either we spend much
    time in a too minute description of things, or enter upon formal and
    argumentative proofs, more than the nature of such accounts will well
    bear. Nevertheless the dignity of the knowledge of antiquities, will
    always insure a sufficient regard for this very considerable branch
    of learning, as long as there is any taste or learning left in the
    world. And indeed we may in short ask, what is all learning, but the
    knowledge of antiquities? a recalling before us the acquirements in
    wisdom, and the deeds of former times. But the way of writing well
    upon them, as I conceive, is so to lay the things together, to put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
    them in such attitude, such a light, as gains upon the affection and
    faith of the reader, in proceeding; without a childish pointing out
    every particular, without a syllogistical proving, or mathematical
    demonstration of them: which are not to be sought for in the case. The
    subject of antiquities must be drawn out with such strong lines of
    verisimilitude, and represented in so lively colours, that the reader
    in effect sees them, as in their first ages: And either brings them
    down to modern times, or raises himself, in the scale of time, as if he
    lived when they were made. Then we may truly say with the poet,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry" lang="la">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0"><i>Scilicet antiquis proficiscitur inde venustas,</i></div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In endeavouring to keep up to such a rule, I must advertise the reader
    of the general purport of this volume. It may be said to consist of
    four parts. Three are descriptions of the three kinds of Druid temples,
    or we may call them patriarchal temples, which I have observed in
    <i>Britain</i>. The fourth will be reflexions upon them, as to their
    antiquity and origin; the founders of such in the more early ages of
    the world, and in the more oriental countries. And tho‚Äô in writing
    the descriptive part of these heads, (which I did on the spot, and
    with great leisure) my papers swell‚Äôd to an enormous bulk; and it was
    necessary for my own right understanding the antiquities: yet I shall
    shorten them exceedingly, in delivering the work to the publick. In
    doing this, I shall be very much helped by the engraven designs which
    at one view give the reader a better notion of the things, than the
    most elaborate descriptions. Likewise in that part of the work wherein
    I reason upon these temples, and trace out the vestiges of such as
    are recorded to us by the learned authors of antiquity now preserved,
    I shall barely lay the appearances of things together; the relation
    between these monuments we now see with our eyes, and the accounts of
    such-like (as I take them) which I find in those authors to have been
    from oldest time. I shall leave the reader to form his judgment from
    such evidence, without endeavouring to force his assent with fancied
    proofs, which will scarce hold good, in matters of so remote an age.
  </p>

  <p>After what I have said in my former volume on <span class="gespertt1"><i>STONEHENGE</i></span>,
    which carries our ideas concerning these antiquities, up to the very
    earliest times of the world; I may venture to discourse a little <i>ex
    priori</i>, concerning the origin of temples in general. And this
    will open my purpose concerning the three first heads of this book:
    the three different kinds of the Druid or patriarchal temples in the
    <i>Britannic</i> isles. If we desire to know any thing of a matter so
    very remote, as in all other affairs of antiquity, we must necessarily
    have recourse to the Bible. And I apprehend, it is mentioned in that
    passage <i>Genesis</i> IV. the last verse; ‚Äúand to <i>Seth</i>, to him
    also there was born a son, and he call‚Äôd his name <i>Enos</i>: then
    began men to call upon the <span class="gespertt1">NAME</span> of the <span class="gespertt1">LORD</span>.‚Äù</p>

  <p>I observe on this passage, the gloss in our <i>English</i> Bibles is
    thus, to call <i>themselves</i> by the name of the <span class="gespertt1">LORD</span>, which is
    very erroneous: <i>themselves</i> is a mere interpolation; and would
    we translate it truly, it ought to be, to <i>call in</i> the name of
    <i>Jehovah</i>; rather, to <i>invoke</i> in the name of <i>Jehovah</i>.
    <i>Vatablus</i> turns it, then began the name of <i>Jehovah</i> to
    be invoked. The jewish writers generally take this passage to mean
    the origin of idolatry, as if it imported, then began men to profane
    the <i>Name</i>, by calling themselves therewith. And our great
    <i>Selden</i> drops into that opinion. But <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>was it probable, the
    divine historian would have been so careful to commemorate an epoch
    so disagreeable? or to what purpose, even before he had so much as
    mention‚Äôd any publick form of true religion? the very wording of
    that verse imports somewhat very remarkable, which he was going to
    declare, ‚Äúand to <i>Seth</i>, to him also there was born a son, and he
    called his name <i>Enos</i>: then began men to invoke in the name of
    <i>Jehovah</i>.‚Äù</p>

  </div>

  <p>In understanding this verse aright, we must certainly affirm that
    <i>Moses</i> intended hereby, to assert the practice of publick
    religion; which necessarily includes two things, the origin of temples,
    and the sabbatical observance. For in all publick actions, time and
    place are equally necessary. In the generation, or days of <i>Enos</i>,
    grandson of <i>Adam</i>, when mankind were multiply‚Äôd into distinct
    families; besides private and family devotion, the publick worship of
    God was introduc‚Äôd in places set apart for that purpose, and on sabbath
    days. Publick worship necessarily implies all this.</p>

  <p>Many and great authorities confirm this understanding of the words,
    as well as the reason of things. The <i>Targum</i> of <i>Onkelos</i>,
    <i>Aquila</i>‚Äôs translation. <i>Rabbi Elieser</i> in <i>Maase
    Bereschit</i> XXII. <i>R. Salomon Jarchi</i>, the <i>Chaldee</i>
    paraphrast. <i lang="la">Vossius in comm.</i> on <i>Maimonides</i> de
    idololatria. And very many more, too tedious to be recited.</p>

  <p>Try the place by other like expressions in scripture, and we find,
    it amounts to the same thing. <i>Genes.</i> xii. 8. <i>Abram</i>
    builded an altar unto <i>Jehovah</i>, and <i>invoked</i> in the name
    of <i>Jehovah</i>. So it ought to be translated. This was the second
    altar he built in <i>Canaan</i>, being the second place he settled at,
    near <i>Bethel</i>. In the preceding verse, we have an account of his
    first settling at <i>Sichem</i>, and of <i>Jehovah</i> appearing to
    him personally and conversing with him: and of his building an altar
    to that <i>Jehovah</i>, who appeared unto him. But I think there is so
    little difficulty in it, that ‚Äôtis needless to multiply authorities or
    argumentations: yet the importance of it demanded thus much.</p>

  <p>Here three things most evidently appear, 1. <i>Jehovah</i> was that
    person in the deity, who appeared visibly and discoursed with the
    patriarchs, not the invisible supreme. 2. That <i>Abram</i> erected
    an altar to this divine person <i>Jehovah</i>, worshipped him, and
    invoked in his <i>name</i>. Invoked whom? the supreme unquestionably,
    <i>i. e.</i> prayed to the supreme Being, in the <i>name</i>, virtue,
    effect, and merit of <i>Jehovah</i>, the mediatorial deity. The word
    <span class="gespertt1">NAME</span>, in these passages of scripture, means the mediatorial deity,
    <span class="gespertt1">JEHOVAH</span> by name: <span lang="el">·Ωâ ŒòŒµŒøœÇ ŒïœÄŒπœÜŒ±ŒΩŒ∑œÇ</span>, the God who appear‚Äôd personally to
    the patriarchs, who was the king of the <i>Mosaic</i> dispensation, and
    of the <i>Jewish</i> people, call‚Äôd the anointed or <i>Messiah</i>, 1
    <i>Sam.</i> ii. 10, 35. he was the captain of the <i>Israelites</i>,
    that conducted them from <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Canaan</i>, <i>Exod.</i>
    xxiii. 20. the royal angel, the king, emperor. The angel of his face
    or presence, <i>Isaiah</i> lxiii. 9. the angel of the covenant,
    <i>Malachi</i> iii. 1. <i>Melech Jehovah</i> the angelick king,
    <i>Zechar.</i> iii. 1, 2, 3, 4. he is very God: for, says the supreme,
    in the before quoted passage in <i>Exodus</i>, <i>behold I send an angel
    before thee</i> (<i>the</i> angel, it ought to be read) <i>to keep thee
    in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
    Beware of him and obey his voice, provoke him not, for he will not
    pardon your transgressions; for my</i> <span class="gespertt1">NAME</span> <i>is in him.</i> This
    same way of speaking <i>Joshua</i> uses, <i>Josh.</i> xxiv. 19.
    <i>Ye cannot serve Jehovah; for he is a holy deity, he is a jealous
    God, he will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins.</i> The
    <i>Jews</i> confess this doctrine to be just. <i>Rabbi Hadersan</i>
    upon that passage in <i>Zephaniah</i> iii. 9. <i>to call upon the</i>
    <span class="gespertt1">NAME</span> <i>of Jehovah</i>, says, this <i>Jehovah</i> is no other than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
    <i>Messiah</i>. All this shews the patriarchs had a knowledge of
    the true nature of the deity, and that the Christian or mediatorial
    religion is the first and the last. And when men were quite deviated
    from the first, the <i>Mosaic</i> dispensation was but an intervening
    vail upon the effulgence and spirituality of true religion for a time,
    to reduce them to it, in the actual advent of the Messiah. 3. These
    altars, as they are here called, were the patriarchal temples like
    those of our druids, the places of publick worship; and invoking in
    the name of <i>Jehovah</i>, is a form of speech importing publick
    worship on sabbath days: equivalent to our saying, to go to church on
    sundays. Whence <i>Servius</i> on the <i>√Üneid</i> III. v. 85. writes,
    in the most ancient manner of worshipping, they only pray‚Äôd directly
    to the deity, without offering sacrifice. And thus I apprehend, we are
    to understand <i>Herodotus</i> II. where he says the <i>Athenians</i>
    learn‚Äôd invoking, of the <i>Pelasgi</i>, who were <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>:
    and probably they had it from <i>Abraham</i>, who was introduc‚Äôd
    into the land of <i>Canaan</i>, as a reformer of religion. Invoking
    was the ordinary method of devotion on sabbath days: sacrificing was
    extraordinary.</p>

  <p>It was <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs custom, wherever he dwelt, to build one
    of these temples: as afterward, in the plain of <i>Mamre</i>, by
    <i>Hebron</i>, <i>Gen.</i> xiii. 18. And at <i>Beersheba</i> we
    are told he planted a grove, and there invoked in the name of
    <i>Jehovah</i>, the everlasting God, <i>Gen.</i> xxi. 33. It cannot
    be doubted but there was an altar and work of stones at the same
    place. And this was the usage of all the patriarchs, his successors,
    ever after; as is obvious in scripture, even to <i>Moses</i>‚Äôs time.
    <i>Isaac</i> builded an altar in <i>Beersheba</i>, and invoked in the
    Name of <i>Jehovah</i>, who personally appear‚Äôd to him, <i>Gen.</i>
    xxvi. 25. <i>Jacob</i> set up the anointed pillar at <i>Bethel</i>,
    xxviii. 18. and the temple there, xxxv. At <i>Shechem</i> he builded
    another, xxxiii. 20. At <i>Bethel</i> he set up a pillar, where
    <i>Jehovah</i> personally appeared to him, and blessed him: he anointed
    it, and poured a drink-offering, or libation thereon, xxxv. 14. In
    <i>Exod.</i> xxiv. 4. we read, <i>Moses rose early in the morning,
    and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars</i>, which
    we have no reason to doubt were set in a circle. The like was done
    after they were seated in the land of <i>Canaan</i>, till the temple
    of <i>Solomon</i> was built: for <i>Samuel</i>, when he dwelt at
    <i>Ramah</i>, built an altar, to <i>Jehovah</i> there, whereat to
    celebrate publick offices of religion, 1 <i>Sam.</i> vii. 17.</p>

  <p>Hence we gather further these three things. 1. That they planted
    groves in patriarchal times, as temples for publick worship. It
    seems that this was done in those hot countries, for convenience in
    the summer-season: and perhaps for magnificence. For we are told,
    <i>Abraham</i> dwelt long at <i>Beersheba</i>, where he planted
    the grove. These were as our cathedrals; they were planted round
    about the circular parts of stones, as porticos for receiving of
    the congregation. Whence groves and temples became a synonymous
    appellation, both in sacred and heathen writers. 2. That these temples
    which they call‚Äôd altars, were circles of stones, inclosing <em>that</em>
    stone more properly nam‚Äôd the altar. The circles were greater or less,
    of more or fewer stones, as the will or convenience of the founder
    prompted. <i>Moses</i> his temple was a circle of twelve stones: and
    such we have in <i>England</i>. 3. They were commonly made on open
    plains, and rising grounds, conspicuous and commodious for multitudes,
    a whole neighbourhood to assemble in. This is the consequence of the
    nature and reason of the thing: for a matter of publick use must be in
    the most publick and conspicuous place. 4. The patriarchal religion,
    and the christian, is but one and the same. Hence in <i>Isaiah</i>
    xix. 19. the prophet speaking of the restitution of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>the patriarchal
    religion in <i>Egypt</i>, under the gospel dispensation, says, ‚ÄúIn
    that day shall there be an altar to <i>Jehovah</i> in the midst of
    the land of <i>Egypt</i>; and a pillar, at the border thereof, to
    <i>Jehovah</i>.‚Äù This is expressly making use of the terms of a
    patriarchal temple, with a view to that religion restor‚Äôd, meaning the
    christian.</p>

  <p>These monuments of the piety of the patriarchs in the eastern parts
    of the world, were in time desecrated to idolatrous purposes, and at
    length destroy‚Äôd, even by the people of <i>Israel</i>, for that reason:
    and temples square in form and cover‚Äôd at top, were introduc‚Äôd at the
    <i>Mosaic</i> dispensation, in direct opposition to that idolatry.
    But before then, that first method pass‚Äôd all over the western world,
    and to <i>Britain</i>, where we see them to this day. By the way, we
    trace some footsteps of them, but there is always a fable annex‚Äôd; as
    generally at this day, in our Druid temples at home. Thus <i>Pausanias
    in corinthiacis</i> informs us, that near the river <i>Chemarus</i>,
    is a <i>septum</i> or circle of stones. He says, they have a report
    there, that this is the place whence <i>Pluto</i> carry‚Äôd away
    <i>Proserpine</i>. By such story we must understand, the mysteries were
    there celebrated. <i>Pausanias</i> writes, that the <i>Thracians</i>
    us‚Äôd to build their temples round, and open at top, in <i>B≈ìotic</i>.
    He speaks of such at <i>Haliartus</i>, by the name of <span lang="el">ŒùŒ±ŒøœÇ</span>, equivalent
    to the <i>Hebrew Beth</i>, which name <i>Jacob</i> gave to his temple.
    He speaks of several altars dedicate to <i>Pluto</i>, set in the
    middle of <i>areas</i> fenc‚Äôd in with stones: and they are call‚Äôd
    <i>hermionenses</i>. He tells us too, among the <i>Orchomenians</i>, is
    a most ancient temple of the <i>Graces</i>, but they worship ‚Äôem in the
    form of stones. From the number three, we may easily guess this was a
    <i>Kist vaen</i>, as our old <i>Britons</i> call it, or <i>Kebla</i>,
    like that in our great temple of <i>Abury</i>, and elsewhere. Indeed,
    the stones of these <i>Kebla</i> in time, instead of a direction in
    worship, became the object of worship; as <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>
    affirms.</p>

  <p>That our Druids were so eminently celebrated for their use of groves,
    shews them to have a more particular relation to <i>Abraham</i>, and
    more immediately from him deriving the usage: by which way, I pointed
    at in good measure, in the account of <i>STONEHENGE</i>. Hence the name
    of Druid imports, priest of the groves; and their verdant cathedrals,
    as we may call them, are celebrated by all old writers that speak of
    this people. We all know the awful and solemn pleasure that strikes one
    upon entering a grove; a kind of religious dread arises from the gloomy
    majesty of the place, very favourable to the purpose intended by them.
    <i>Servius</i> upon <i>√Üneid</i> III.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry" lang="la">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0"><i>Ante urbem in luco falsi Simo√´ntis ad undam,</i></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">observes, <i>Virgil</i> never mentions a grove without a note of
    religion. Again, <i>√Üneid</i> IX. <i>ver.</i> 4. <i>Strabo</i> says,
    the poets call temples by the name of groves. And this is frequently
    done in the scripture. But it is natural for our classic writers,
    when speaking of the Druids and their great attachment to religious
    rites, so different from what they were acquainted with, to insist much
    upon their groves; overlooking our monuments, which they would scarce
    dignify with the name of temples, because not covered like their own.
    Yet if with some, we would from hence conclude, that they were the only
    temples of the Druids, and therefore <i>Stonehenge</i> and the works we
    are upon, were none of theirs, we should err as much, as if we asserted
    <i>Abraham</i> only made use of groves, and not of the other temples
    erected on plains and open places.</p>

  <p>Thus far I premis‚Äôd with brevity, as an introduction to our discourse,
    shewing the origin of temples among mankind; a necessary provision for
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
    that duty we owe to our sovereign author and benefactor. For unless
    we can prove ourselves self-sufficient and independent, all nature
    cries aloud for our acknowledgment of this duty. Private and domestic
    prayer is our duty as private persons and families, that we have life,
    and subsistence, and the common protection of providence: but the
    profession and exercise of publick religion is equally necessary as we
    are a community, a part of the publick, a parish, a city, a nation,
    link‚Äôd together by government, for our common safety and protection;
    in order to implore at the hands of God almighty the general blessings
    of life, wanting to us in that capacity. And that person who secludes
    himself from his share in this duty, is a rebel and traitor to the
    publick, and is virtually separated from the common blessings of
    heaven. But <em>time</em> is equally necessary to this publick duty as
    <em>place</em>, as every one‚Äôs reason must dictate. Therefore was the
    sabbath instituted; the very first command of our maker, even in the
    happy seat of <i>Paradise</i>, and before our fatal transgression. ‚ÄôTis
    the positive institution of God, and founded upon the strictest reason.
    So that if we allow the patriarchs to have built these temples, wherein
    to assemble for publick devotion, and disallow of the sabbath, because
    not particularly mention‚Äôd in the scripture that they did celebrate
    it, we think absurdly, and err against common sense and reason. The
    scriptures were given to teach us religion, but not to inform us of
    common sense and reason.</p>

  <p>The duty of the sabbath commences as early as our being, and is
    included with great propriety in that observation of the divine
    historian concerning <i>Adam</i>‚Äôs grandson, <i>Enos</i>; when it
    pass‚Äôd from a family-ordinance to that of several families united, as
    then was the case. The particularity of the expression, <i>invoking</i>
    in the name of <i>Jehovah</i>, dictates to us the form of their
    religion, founded on the mediatorial scheme, which Mediator was a
    divine person, to be worshipped; and thro‚Äô our faith and hope in him,
    or in his <i>Name</i>, we were to invoke God almighty for our pardon
    and protection. Therefore the same scheme of religion subsists, from
    the beginning to this day, the <i>Mosaic</i> system intervening chiefly
    as a remedy against idolatry, till the world was prepar‚Äôd for the great
    advent; and patriarchal religion should be republish‚Äôd under the name
    of christian.</p>

  <p>From all this we must conclude, that the ancients knew somewhat of the
    mysterious nature of the deity, subsisting in distinct personalities,
    which is more fully reveal‚Äôd to us in the christian dispensation. All
    nature, our senses, common reason assures us of the one supreme and
    self-originated being. The second person in the deity is discoverable
    in almost every page of the old testament. After his advent, he informs
    us more fully of the nature of the third person: and that third
    person is discoverable in almost every page of the new testament.
    That the ancients had some knowledge of this great truth, the learned
    <i>Steuchus Eugubinus</i> demonstrates, in <i>perenni philosoph.</i>
    from their writings which are still left, such as <i>Hermes</i>,
    <i>Orpheus</i>, <i>Hydaspes</i>, <i>Pythagoras</i>, <i>Plato</i>, the
    <i>Platonics</i>, the sibylline verses, the oracles, and the like.
    Our <i>Cudworth</i> has very laudably pursued the same track, and
    <i>Kircher</i>, and our <i>Ramsey</i> in his history of <i>Cyrus</i>,
    and many more, to whom I refer the curious reader, who has a mind to be
    convinced of it. I shall only add this, that upon supposition only of
    an ancient tradition of it, having been handed down from one generation
    to another, in order to light up and kindle our reason concerning it;
    that ‚Äôtis a doctrine so far from being contrary to reason, or above
    human reason, that ‚Äôtis deducible therefrom, and perfectly agreeable to
    it, as I shall shew in <a href="#CHAP_XV">Chap. XV.</a>
  </p>

  <p>Nor is this a slight matter; for if knowledge be a valuable thing,
    if it be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>the highest ornament and felicity to the human mind; the
    most divine part of all knowledge is to know somewhat of the nature of
    the deity. This knowledge the Druids assuredly attempted to come at,
    and obtained, as we gather from the different kinds of their temples;
    and when we have described them, we shall beg leave to resume this
    argument, and briefly to discourse on it again, as being the chief and
    ultimate purpose of all antique inquiries.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">TEMPLE</span> is a word deriv‚Äôd from the <i>greek</i> <span lang="el">Œ§ŒµŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ</span>, a place cut
    off, inclosed, dedicated to sacred use, whether an area, a circle of
    stones, a field, or a grove. This matter, as all others, advanced from
    simplicity, by degrees, till it became what we now call a temple. Thus
    we read in <i>Iliad</i> II, of <i>Ceres</i>‚Äôs field. <i>Iliad</i> VIII, of
    <i>Jupiter</i>‚Äôs field and altar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
    In XXIII, another at the fountain of
    <i>Sperchius</i>. In <i>Odyss.</i> VIII, that of <i>Venus Paphia</i>.
    <i>Pausanias</i> mentions many of these. <i>Cicero</i> too among the
    <i>Thebans</i>, <i lang="la">de nat. deor.</i> III. In <i>Odyss.</i> XVII, a
    grove perfectly round by <i>Ithaca</i>. And these were encompass‚Äôd by
    a ditch which <i>Pollux</i> calls <i>peribolus</i>. <i>Pausanias</i>
    makes this particular remark in <i>Achaic</i>, of the grove of <i>Diana
    servatrix</i>. They were kept by priests who dwelt there for that
    purpose, as <i>Maron</i> in <i>Odyss.</i> IX.</p>

  <p><i>Tempe</i> signifies a grove or temple, which is the same thing.
    <i>Strabo</i> writes, that the poets, for ornament sake, call all
    temples groves. This was in affectation of antiquity.

  <p class="noindent"><i>Tempulum</i>, or contractedly <i>templum</i>, is a lesser grove,
    or temple properly speaking, built with pillars, as it were in
    imitation of a great grove. The patriarchal <i>temeni</i> were call‚Äôd
    <span lang="he">◊ë◊û◊ô◊î</span> <i>excelsa</i>, because generally made on high places. Hence
    the <i>greek</i> word <span lang="el">Œ≤œâŒºŒøœÇ</span>. By the <i>hebrew</i> writers they were
    call‚Äôd <i>sacella montana</i>, mountain oratories. <i>Sacellum</i>,
    says <i>Festus</i>, is an open chapel, or without a roof. At length
    the word temple was apply‚Äôd to sacred structures built with a roof, in
    imitation of <i>Solomon</i>‚Äôs. And that was a durable and fixed one,
    an edifice of extraordinary grandeur and beauty, made in imitation of
    the <i>Mosaic</i> tabernacle, which was a temple itinerant, the first
    idea of a cover‚Äôd one, properly. There were two reasons, among others,
    why it was cover‚Äôd and square in form. 1. By way of opposition to
    the heathen ones, practised in all the countries round about, which
    were imitations of the first patriarchal temples there, and now were
    converted to idolatrous purposes. 2. Because it was a type of Messiah,
    or <span class="gespertt1"><i>JEHOVAH</i></span> who was to come in the flesh, therefore cover‚Äôd with
    skins. And that we may have the greatest authority in the case, our
    Saviour himself declares in the most publick manner, that the temple of
    <i>Jerusalem</i> was symbolical of his body, as we find it recorded in
    the gospel, <i>John</i> ii. 19. And the author of the <i>Hebrews</i>
    largely deduces the necessity of making temples to be the pictures
    of heavenly things, and particularly of the mediator, <i>Heb.</i>
    ix. 11, 23. which can be done no otherwise than symbolically. And
    authors that describe the tabernacle and temple, insist upon this
    largely. Nor is it otherwise with us christians, in our cathedrals,
    designing our saviour‚Äôs body extended on the cross. But in the more
    ancient patriarchal times, before the great advent, they form‚Äôd them
    upon the geometrical figures or pictures, or manner of writing, by
    which they express‚Äôd the deity, and the mystical nature thereof. And
    this same design of making temples in some kind of imitation of the
    deity, as well as they could conceive it, was from the very beginning.
    The heathen authors retain some notion of this matter, when they
    tell us, of temples being made in the form and nature of the gods.
    <i>Porphyry</i> in <i>Eusebius pr. ev.</i> III. 7. affirms the round
    figure to be dedicated to eternity, and that they anciently built
    temples round; but he did not understand the whole reason. And when
    they built temples properly, in imitation of the jewish, they made them
    often of a round form, and often open at top, to preserve as near as
    might be, the most ancient manner they had been acquainted with. Whence
    <i>Pausanias</i> writes, the <i>Thracians</i> us‚Äôd to build their
    temples round, and open at top.</p>

  <p>Thus at <i>Bethel</i>, the place where <i>Jacob</i> built his temple,
    and where his grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>father <i>Abraham</i> had built one before,
    <i>Jeroboam</i> chose it for his idolatrous temple, call‚Äôd by the
    <i>Alexandrian Greeks</i> in after times, <span lang="el">ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ Œ©ŒΩ</span>, the temple of
    <i>On</i>. <i>S. Cyril</i> in his comments on <i>Hosea</i> writes,
    that <i>On</i> is the sun, from its round form. The heathen had done
    all they could to corrupt the remembrance of the name of the true
    God, and turn‚Äôd <i>Beth-el</i>, which signifies the house of <span class="gespertt1">EL</span> or God,
    to <span lang="el">ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ Œ©ŒΩ</span>, the house of <i>On</i>, or the sun. As <span lang="el">Œ∑ŒªŒπŒøœÇ</span>, is a word
    undoubtedly made from <span class="gespertt1">EL</span>, in the <i>Hebrew</i>, expressing God‚Äôs power
    and sovereignty; so much like <i>Elion</i> a name of God in Scripture,
    signifying <i>Hypsistus</i>, the most high. <i>Gen.</i> xiv. 18.
    <i>Luke</i> i. 37. in <i>Arabic</i>, <i>allah ta√¢la</i> the most high
    God. Whence <i>Atlas</i> the name of consecration of the <i>African</i>
    hero, <i>allah ta√¢l</i>.</p>

  <p>When these ancient patriarchal temples in other countries came to
    be perverted to idolatry, they consecrated many of them to the sun,
    thinking their round form ought to be referr‚Äôd to his disc; and
    that these pyramidal stones, set in a circle, imitated his rays.
    Hence call‚Äôd <i>Aglibelus</i>, <i>rotundus Deus</i>, as interpreted by
    <i>Bochart</i>. <span lang="he">◊¢◊í◊ú ◊ë◊¢◊ú</span>, <span lang="el">Œ∂ŒµœÖœÇ ŒµœÄŒπŒ∫œÖŒ∫ŒªŒπŒøœÇ</span> among the orientals, as
    <i>Schedius</i> observes. And had the ancient <i>Greek</i> writers
    seen our temples of <i>Stonehenge</i>, and the rest, they would have
    concluded them dedicated to the sun.</p>

  <p>These temples of ours are always of a round form: and there are
    innumerable of them, all over the <i>Britannic</i> isles, nevertheless
    they are to be ranked into three kinds; for tho‚Äô they are all
    circular, yet there are three manifest diversities which I have
    observ‚Äôd, regarding that threefold figure, by which the ancients,
    probably even from <i>Adam</i>‚Äôs time, express‚Äôd in writing, the
    great idea of the deity. This figure by <i>Kircher</i> is call‚Äôd
    <i>ophio-cyclo-pterygo-morphus</i>. ‚ÄôTis a circle with wings, and a
    snake proceeding from it. A figure excellently well design‚Äôd to picture
    out the intelligence they had, no doubt, by divine communication, of
    the mysterious nature of the deity. And it was the way of the ancients
    in their religious buildings, to copy out or analogize the form of the
    divine being, as they conceiv‚Äôd it, in a symbolical manner. By this
    means they produc‚Äôd a most effectual prophylact, as they thought, which
    could not fail of drawing down the blessings of divine providence upon
    that place and country, as it were, by sympathy and similitude.</p>

  <p>I shall therefore make it the subject of the present volume, to
    describe one or two of each sort of the temples built upon the plan of
    these figures: wherein the founders have left an incontestible proof
    of that knowledge which the ancient world had of the divine nature, by
    these durable and magnificent monuments. The remainder of these temples
    (as many as are come to my knowledge) together with the places of the
    sports and games of the ancient <i>Britons</i>, and the religion of the
    Druids, I shall publish in the succeeding volume.</p>

  <p>Names or words are necessary for the understanding of things; therefore
    1. The round temples simply, I call temples; 2. Those with the form of
    a snake annext, as that of <i>Abury</i>, I call serpentine temples, or
    <i>Dracontia</i>, by which they were denominated of old; 3. Those with
    the form of wings annext, I call alate or winged temples. And these
    are all the kinds of Druid temples that I know of. We may call these
    figures, the symbols of the patriarchal religion, as the cross is of
    the christian. Therefore they built their temples according to those
    figures.</p>

  <h3><i>ROWLDRICH.</i></h3>

  <p>I shall begin with <i>Rowlright</i> or rather <i>Rowldrich</i>, and
    as a specimen of what requisites are sought for in these enquiries,
    I shall draw them up in a kind of order: which may be useful in all
    researches of this sort.</p>

  <p>1. A situation on high ground, open heaths, by heads of rivers.</p>

  <p>ROWLDRICH is a temple of the Druids of the first kind, a circular
    work which has been often taken notice of in print, lying in the
    north-west part of <i>Oxfordshire</i>: upon high ground, where the
    counties of <i>Oxford</i>, <i>Warwick</i>, and <i>Glocester</i>
    meet. ‚ÄôTis near the town of <i>Chippin-Norton</i>. Two rivers rise
    here, that run with quite contrary directions; the <i>Evenlode</i>
    towards the south part of the kingdom, which joining the <i>Isis</i>
    below <i>Woodstock</i>, visits the great luminary of <i>Britain</i>,
    <i>Oxford</i>, and then meets the <i>Thames</i> at <i>Dorchester</i>,
    the ancient <i>Episcopal see</i> of the <i>Mercian</i> kingdom. At
    this <i>Dorchester</i> are fine remains both of <i>Saxon</i> church
    antiquity, of <i>Roman</i>, and of <i>British</i>. The inquisitive that
    prefer our own country antiquities to the vain tour of foreign, will
    find much of curious amusement there. The other river <i>Stour</i>
    runs from <i>Rowldrich</i> directly north, to meet the <i>Avon</i>
    at <i>Stratford</i>, thence to the <i>Severn</i> sea. So that
    <i>Rowldrich</i> must needs stand on very high ground, and to those
    that attentively consider the place itself, it appears to be a large
    cop‚Äôd hill, on the summit of an open down; and the temple together with
    the Archdruid‚Äôs barrow hard by, stand on the very tip of it, having a
    descent every way thence: and an extensive prospect, especially into
    <i>Glocestershire</i> and <i>Warwickshire</i>. The country hereabouts
    was originally an open, barren heath; and underneath, a quarry of a
    kind of rag stone. At present near here are some inclosures, which have
    been plough‚Äôd up. The major part of our antiquity remains: tho‚Äô many
    of the stones have been carried away within memory, to make bridges,
    houses, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>2. ‚ÄôTis an open temple of a circular form, made of stones set upright
    in the ground. The stones are rough and unhewn, and were (as I
    apprehend) taken from the surface of the ground. I saw stones lying in
    the field north of <i>Norton</i>, not far off, of good bulk, and the
    same kind as those of our antiquity. There are such in other places
    hereabouts, whence the Druids took them: tho‚Äô in the main, carry‚Äôd off
    ever since, for building and other uses.</p>

  <p>3. We observe the effect of the weather upon these works. This we are
    treating of, stands in a corner of the hedge of the inclosure, near the
    northern summit of the hill, ‚Äúa great monument of antiquity,‚Äù says the
    excellent Mr. <i>Camden</i>, ‚Äúa number of vastly great stones plac‚Äôd
    in a circular figure. They are of unequal height and shape, very much
    ragged, impair‚Äôd and decay‚Äôd by time.‚Äù Indeed as from hence we must
    form some judgment of their age, we may pronounce them not inferior to
    any in that respect; corroded like worm-eaten wood, by the harsh jaws
    of time, and that much more than <i>Stonehenge</i>, which is no mean
    argument of its being the work of the Druids.</p>

  <p>4. We are led to this conclusion from the name. Mr. <i>Camden</i>
    calls them <i>Rolle-rich</i> stones. Dr. <i>Holland</i> in his note
    says, in a book in the <i>Exchequer</i> (perhaps he means doomsday
    book) the town adjacent, (whence its name) is <i>Rollendrich</i>,
    if it was wrote exactly, I suppose it would be <i>Rholdrwyg</i>,
    which means the Druids‚Äô <i>wheel</i> or <i>circle</i>. <i>Rhwyll</i>
    likewise in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
    <i>British</i>, is <i>cancelli</i>, for these stones
    are set pretty near together, so as almost to become a continued
    wall, or <i>cancellus</i>. Further, the word <i>Roilig</i> in the
    old <i>irish</i> language, signifies a church; then it imports the
    <i>Druids‚Äô</i> church, <i>chancel</i>, or <i>temple</i>, in the first
    acceptation of the word. We may call this place the <i>Gilgal</i> of
    <i>Britain</i>, to speak in the oriental manner, a word equivalent to
    the <i>Celtic Rhol</i>, a wheel or circle, which gave name to that
    famous camp or fortress where the host of <i>Israel</i> first pitch‚Äôd
    their tents in the land of <i>Canaan</i>; after they pass‚Äôd the river
    <i>Jordan</i> in a miraculous manner, dry-shod, as ‚Äôtis described in
    the sublimest manner, and equal to the dignity of the subject, in
    <i>Joshua</i> iv. There also we read, that <i>Joshua</i> caused twelve
    men, a man out of each tribe, to pitch twelve stones in the channel of
    the river <i>Jordan</i>, where the ark stood whilst the people pass‚Äôd
    over, when the stream was cut off; they were set there for a memorial.
    And they likewise took up twelve stones out of the bed of the river,
    and <i>Joshua</i> pitch‚Äôd them in <i>Gilgal</i>, in a circular form,
    which gave name to the place, meaning a <i>rhowl</i> or <i>wheel</i>.
    And to this he alludes in the next chapter, in that passage, which
    otherwise is difficult to be understood; for here <i>Joshua</i>
    circumcised the people, that rite having been omitted in the young
    race during their peregrination in the wilderness: ‚ÄúAnd the <span class="gespertt1">LORD</span> said
    unto <i>Joshua</i>, this day have I <i>rolled</i> away the reproach of
    <i>Egypt</i> from off you; wherefore the name of the place is called
    <i>Gilgal</i> unto this day.‚Äù</p>

  </div>

  <p>Commentators not apprehending this, run into many odd solutions,
    as not seeing a reason between <i>name</i> and <i>thing</i>. Some
    therefore suppose it so call‚Äôd, because from hence <i>Joshua</i>
    conquer‚Äôd all his enemies <i>round about</i>, and the like. But the
    truth is, <i>Joshua</i> set the stones in a circular form, like the
    ancient temples; but placed no altar there, because they had no need
    to use it as a temple, where the tabernacle was present, therefore
    call‚Äôd it simply the <i>wheel</i>. So I doubt not but the altar which
    <i>Moses</i> built under mount <i>Sinai</i>, with twelve pillars, was
    a circular work, as our Druid temples, <i>Exod.</i> xxiv. 4. The like
    we ought to think of the altar which <i>Moses</i> built, and called
    <i>Jehovah Nissi</i>, which the heathen perverted into <i>Jupiter
    Nyseus</i>, or <i>Dionysus</i>, <i>Exod.</i> xvii. 15. The like must be
    affirm‚Äôd of all the patriarchal altars of <i>Abraham</i>, <i>Isaac</i>,
    and <i>Jacob</i>. These works of ours prove it, which are but little
    later in time, and made in imitation of theirs; and without a pun, or
    false logic, these matters may be said to prove each other in a circle;
    where ‚Äôtis absurd to demand any positive proof thro‚Äô extreme distance
    of times and places. I apprehend nothing further ought to be expected
    from us than to lay together circumstantial evidence, a concurrence
    of numerous and strong verisimilitudes; as is now the case with us
    concerning <i>Rowldrich</i>.</p>

  <p>5. We very justly infer this is a temple of the Druids, from the
    measure it is built upon. In a letter from Mr. <i>Roger Gale</i> to
    me, dated from <i>Worcester, Aug. 19, 1719</i>, having been to visit
    this antiquity at my request, he tells me, the diameter of the circle
    is 35 yards. So the bishop of <i>London</i> writes, the distance at
    <i>Stonehenge</i> from the entrance of the area to the temple itself
    is 35 yards; so the diameter of <i>Stonehenge</i> is 35 yards. We
    suppose this is not measur‚Äôd with a mathematical exactness; but when
    we look into the comparative scale of <i>English</i> feet and cubits,
    we discern 60 cubits of the Druids is the measure sought for. The
    diameter of the outer circle of <i>Stonehenge</i>, and this circle at
    <i>Rowldrich</i>, are exactly equal.</p>

  <p>I have repeated the table of the Druid cubits collated with our
    <i>English</i> feet, which will be of service to us throughout this
    work, <a href="#tab_II">plate II.</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

  <p>The circle itself is compos‚Äôd of stones of various shapes and
    dimensions, set pretty near together, as may best be seen by the
    drawings, <span class="smcap">Table</span> <a href="#tab_III">III</a>, <a href="#tab_IV">IV.</a>
    They are flattish, about 16 inches
    thick. Originally there seems to have been 60 in number, at present
    there are 22 standing, few exceeding 4 foot in height; but one in the
    very north point much higher than the rest, 7 foot high, 5¬Ω broad.
    There was an entrance to it from the north-east, as is the case at
    <i>Stonehenge</i>. <i>Ralph Sheldon</i>, esquire, dug in the middle of
    the circle at <i>Rowldrich</i>, but found nothing.</p>

  <p>6. Another argument of its being a Druid temple, is taken from the
    barrows all around it, according to the constant practice in these
    places. To the north-east is a great <i>tumulus</i> or barrow of a long
    form, which I suppose to have been of an arch-druid. Between it and our
    temple is a huge stone standing upright, called the <i>kingstone</i>;
    the stone is 8 foot high, 7 broad, which, together with the barrow, may
    be seen in <span class="smcap">Tables</span> <a href="#tab_III">III</a>, <a href="#tab_V">V.</a>
    but the barrow has had much dug away
    from it. ‚ÄôTis now above 60 foot in length, 20 in breadth, flattish at
    top.</p>

  <p>I know not whether there were more stones standing originally about
    this barrow, or that this belong‚Äôd to some part of the administration
    of religious offices in the temple, as a single stone.</p>

  <p>In the same plate may be seen another barrow, but circular, below
    the road to the left hand, on the side of the hill. Under it is a
    spring-head running eastward to <i>Long Compton</i>. This barrow
    has had stone-work at the east end of it. Upon this same heath
    eastward, in the way to <i>Banbury</i>, are many barrows of different
    shapes, within sight of <i>Rowldrich</i>; particularly, near a place
    call‚Äôd <i>Chapel</i> on the heath, is a large, flat, and circular
    <i>tumulus</i>, ditch‚Äôd about, with a small tump in the center: this
    is what I call a Druid‚Äôs barrow; many such near <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    some whereof I opened; a small circular barrow a little way off it.
    There are on this heath too, many circular dish-like cavities, as near
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, we may call them barrows inverted.</p>

  <p>Not far from the Druid‚Äôs barrow I saw a square work, such as I call
    Druids‚Äô courts or houses. Such near <i>Stonehenge</i> and <i>Abury</i>.
    ‚ÄôTis a place 100 cubits square, double-ditch‚Äôd. The earth of the
    ditches is thrown inward between the ditches, so as to a raise a
    terrace, going quite round. The ditches are too inconsiderable to be
    made for defence. Within are seemingly remains of stone walls. ‚ÄôTis
    within sight of the temple, and has a fine prospect all around, being
    seated on the highest part of the ridge. A little further is a small
    round barrow, with stone-work at the east end, like that before spoken
    of near <i>Rowldrich</i>; a dry stone wall or fence running quite over
    it, across the heath.</p>

  <p>Return we nearer to the temple, and we see 300 paces directly east from
    it in the same field, a remarkable monument much taken notice of; ‚Äôtis
    what the old <i>Britons</i> call a <i>Kist vaen</i> or stone chest;
    I mean the <i>Welsh</i>, the descendants of those invaders from the
    continent, <i>Belg√¶</i>, <i>Gauls</i> and <i>Cimbrians</i>, who drove
    away the aboriginal inhabitants, that made the works we are treating
    of, still northward. Hence they gave them these names from appearances;
    as <i>Rowldrich</i>, the <i>wheel or circle of the Druids</i>; as
    <i>Stonehenge</i> they call‚Äôd <i>choir gaur</i>, the <i>giants‚Äô
    dance</i>; as our <i>saxon</i> ancestors call‚Äôd it <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    the <i>hanging-stones</i>, or <i>stone-gallows</i>. Every succession
    of inhabitants being still further remov‚Äôd from a true notion and
    knowledge of the things.</p>

  <p>Our <i>Kist vaen</i>
    is represented in plates <a href="#tab_VI">VI.</a> and <a href="#tab_VII">VII.</a> One shews
    the fore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>side, the other the backside; so that there needs but
    little description of it. ‚ÄôTis compos‚Äôd of six stones, one broader
    for the back-part, two and two narrower for the sides, set square to
    the former; and above all, as a cover, a still larger. The opening is
    full west, to the temple, or <i>Rowldrich</i>. It stands on a round
    <i>tumulus</i>, and has a fine prospect south-westward down the valley,
    where the head of the river <i>Evenlode</i> runs. I persuade myself
    this was merely monumental, erected over the grave of some great person
    there buried; most probably the king of the country, when this temple
    was built. And if there was any use of the building, it might possibly
    be some way accommodated to some anniversary commemoration of the
    deceased, by feasts, games, exercises, or the like, as we read in the
    classic poets, who describe customs ancienter than their own times. It
    is akin to that <i>Kist vaen</i> in <i>Cornwall</i>, which I have drawn
    in <a href="#tab_XXXVII">plate XXXVII</a>.</p>

  <p class="clear mt3">Near the arch-druid‚Äôs barrow, by that call‚Äôd the <i>Kingstone</i>, is
    a square plat, oblong, form‚Äôd on the turf. Hither, on a certain day of
    the year, the young men and maidens customarily meet, and make merry
    with cakes and ale. And this seems to be the remain of the very ancient
    festival here celebrated in memory of the interr‚Äôd, for whom the long
    barrow and temple were made. This was the sepulture of the arch-druid
    founder. At <i>Enston</i>, a little way off, between <i>Neat Enston</i>
    and <i>Fulwell</i>, by the side of a bank or <i>tumulus</i>, stands
    a great stone, with other smaller. ‚ÄôTis half a mile south-west of
    <i>Enston</i> church. A famous barrow at <i>Lineham</i>, by the banks
    of the <i>Evenlode</i>.</p>

  <p>7. Mr. <i>Camden</i> writes further concerning our antiquity, that ‚Äúthe
    country people have a fond tradition, that they were once men, turn‚Äôd
    into stones. The highest of all, which lies out of the ring, they call
    the <i>king</i>. Five larger stones, which are at some distance from
    the circle, set close together, they pretend were knights, the ring
    were common soldiers.‚Äù This story the country people, for some miles
    round, are very fond of, and take it very ill if any one doubts of it;
    nay, they are in danger of being stoned for their unbelief. They have
    likewise rhymes and sayings relating thereto. Suchlike reports are to
    be met with in other like works, our Druid temples. They savour of the
    most ancient and heroic times. Like <i>Perseus</i>, turning men into
    stones; like <i>Cadmus</i>, producing men from serpents‚Äô teeth; like
    <i>Deucalion</i>, by throwing stones over his head, and such like,
    which we shall have occasion to mention again, <a href="#CHAP_XIV">chap. XIV.</a></p>

  <p>8. We may very reasonably affirm, that this temple was built here,
    on account of this long barrow. And very often in ancient times
    temples owe their foundation to sepulchres, as well as now. <i>Clemens
    Alexandrinus</i> in <i>Protrept.</i> and <i>Eusebius</i>, both allow
    it; and it is largely treated of in <i>Schedius</i> and other authors;
    ‚Äôtis a common thing among these works of our Druids, and an argument
    that this is a work of theirs. I shall only make two observations
    therefrom. 1. That it proceeded from a strong notion in antiquity of a
    future state, and that in respect of their bodies as well as souls; for
    the temples are thought prophylactic, and have a power of protecting
    and preserving the remains of the dead. 2. That it was the occasion
    of consecrating and idolizing of dead heroes, the first species of
    idolatry; for they by degrees advanc‚Äôd them into those deities of which
    these figures were symbols, whereof we shall meet with instances in the
    progress of this work.</p>

  <p>Thus we pronounce <i>Rowldrich</i> a Druid temple, from a concurrence
    of all the appearances to be expected in the case; from its round form,
    situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
    on high ground, near springs, on an extended heath, from the
    stones taken from the surface of the ground, from the name, from the
    measure it is built on, from the wear of the weather, from the barrows
    of various kinds about it, from ancient reports, from its apparent
    conformity to those patriarchal temples mentioned in scripture. This
    is the demonstration to be expected in such antiquities. Nor shall I
    spend time in examining the notion of its belonging to <i>Rollo</i>
    the <i>Dane</i>, and the like. Mr. <i>Camden</i> had too much judgment
    to mention it. ‚ÄôTis confuted in the annotations to <i>Britannia</i>,
    and in <i>Selden</i>‚Äôs notes on <i>Drayton</i>‚Äôs <i>Polyolbion</i>, page 224.
    And let this suffice for what I can say upon this curious and ancient
    monument: the first kind, and most common of the Druid temples, a plain
    circle: of which there are innumerable all over the <i>Britannick</i>
    isles; being the original form of all temples, ‚Äôtill the Mosaick
    tabernacle.</p>

    <i>Stonehenge</i> we have endeavoured to describe; and we are not more

    circular ditch, of above 1000 foot diameter. And what will further
    excite one‚Äôs curiosity, the <i>vallum</i> or earth, which is of solid
    chalk, dug out of that ditch, thrown on the outside; quite contrary
    to the nature of castles and fortifications. The ditch alone, which
    is wide and deep, is a very great labour, and the rampart very high,
    and makes the appearance of a huge amphitheatre, for an innumerable
    company of spectators; but cannot possibly be design‚Äôd for offence or
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
    defence. This is twice passed by all the travellers: and its oddness
    would arrest one‚Äôs attention, if the stones escap‚Äôd it.</p>

  <p>The mighty carcase of <i>Stonehenge</i> draws great numbers of people,
    out of their way every day, as to see a sight: and it has exercis‚Äôd the
    pens of the learned to account for it. But <i>Abury</i> a much greater
    work and more extensive design, by I know not what unkind fate, was
    altogether overlooked, and in the utmost danger of perishing, thro‚Äô
    the humor of the country people, but of late taken up, of demolishing
    the stones. Mr. <i>Camden</i> the great light of <i>British</i>
    antiquities, took <i>Kennet</i> avenue to be plain rocks, and that
    the village of <i>Rockley</i> took its name from them. It is strange
    that two parallel lines of great stones, set at equal distance and
    intervals, for a mile together, should be taken for rocks in their
    natural site. As for the town of <i>Rockley</i>, ‚Äôtis four miles off,
    has nothing to do with this antiquity, tho‚Äô probably had its name from
    the adjacent gray weathers, whence our stones were drawn.</p>

  <p>Dr. <i>Holland</i>, his annotator, writes thus of it. ‚ÄúWithin one
    mile of <i>Selbury</i>, (by which he means <i>Silbury-hill</i>) is
    <i>Abury</i>, an uplandish village, built in an old camp, as it
    seemeth, but of no large compass. It is environed with a fair trench,
    and hath four gates, in two of which stand huge stones, as jambs; but
    so rude, that they seem rather natural than artificial: of which sort,
    there are some other, in the said village.‚Äù In the time, when this was
    wrote, all the circles of these great stones, within the village of
    <i>Abury</i>, were nearly perfect; two of about 150 foot diameter, two
    of 300 foot diameter, and the great one of above 1000: which merited
    a higher notice. The largeness of the circles hinder‚Äôd an incurious
    spectator from discerning their purpose.</p>

  <p>I persuade my self the intelligent reader, by casting his eye over the
    plate in the <a href="#tab_I">frontispiece</a>, being the village of <i>Abury</i>, will see
    enough to excite a vast idea of the place: more so, if they conceive
    that the two avenues of <i>Kennet</i> and <i>Bekamton</i>, going off at
    the bottom, to the right and the left, extend themselves each, above a
    mile from the town.</p>

  <p>Dr. <i>Childrey</i> likewise, in his <i>Britannia Baconica</i>, takes
    these stones about <i>Kennet</i> to be mere rocks. Thus if our minds
    are not properly dispos‚Äôd for these inquiries, or we believe nothing
    great in art, preceded the times of the <i>Romans</i>, we may run into
    <i>Munster</i>‚Äôs error, in <i>cosmograph.</i> iii. 49. who believes,
    plain <i>celtic</i> urns dug up in <i>Poland</i>, to be the work of
    nature. <i>Harrington</i> in his notes on <i>Orlando furioso</i> speaks
    likewise of <i>Abury</i>.</p>

  <p>Just before I visited this place, to endeavour at preserving the memory
    of it, the inhabitants were fallen into the custom of demolishing
    the stones, chiefly out of covetousness of the little <i>area</i>
    of ground, each stood on. First they dug great pits in the earth,
    and buried them. The expence of digging the grave, was more than
    30 years purchase of the spot they possess‚Äôd, when standing. After
    this, they found out the knack of burning them; which has made most
    miserable havock of this famous temple. One <i>Tom Robinson</i> the
    <i>Herostratus</i> of <i>Abury</i>, is particularly eminent for this
    kind of execution, and he very much glories in it. The method is, to
    dig a pit by the side of the stone, till it falls down, then to burn
    many loads of straw under it. They draw lines of water along it when
    heated, and then with smart strokes of a great sledge hammer, its
    prodigious bulk is divided into many lesser parts. But this <i lang="la">Atto de
    fe</i> commonly costs thirty shillings in fire and labour, sometimes
    twice as much. They own too ‚Äôtis excessive hard work; for these stones
    are often 18 foot long, 13 broad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
    and 6 thick; that their weight
    crushes the stones in pieces, which they lay under them to make them
    lie hollow for burning; and for this purpose they raise them with
    timbers of 20 foot long, and more, by the help of twenty men; but often
    the timbers were rent in pieces.</p>

  <p>They have sometimes us‚Äôd of these stones for building houses; but
    say, they may have them cheaper, in more manageable pieces, from the
    gray weathers. One of these stones will build an ordinary house; yet
    the stone being a kind of marble, or rather granite, is always moist
    and dewy in winter, which proves damp and unwholsom, and rots the
    furniture. The custom of thus destroying them is so late, that I could
    easily trace the <i>obit</i> of every stone; who did it, for what
    purpose, and when, and by what method, what house or wall was built out
    of it, and the like. Every year that I frequented this country, I found
    several of them wanting; but the places very apparent whence they were
    taken. So that I was well able, as then, to make a perfect ground-plot
    of the whole, and all its parts. This is now twenty years ago. ‚ÄôTis to
    be fear‚Äôd, that had it been deferr‚Äôd ‚Äôtill this time, it would have
    been impossible. And this stupendous fabric, which for some thousands
    of years had brav‚Äôd the continual assaults of weather, and by the
    nature of it, when left to itself, like the pyramids of <i>Egypt</i>,
    would have lasted as long as the globe, must have fallen a sacrifice to
    the wretched ignorance and avarice of a little village unluckily plac‚Äôd
    within it; and the curiosity of the thing would have been irretrievable.</p>

  <p>Such is the modern history of <i>Abury</i>, which I thought proper to
    premise, to prepare the mind of the reader. All this was done in my
    original memoirs, which I wrote on the spot, very largely. Tho‚Äô it was
    necessary for me then to do it, in order to get a thorough intelligence
    of the work; yet I shall commit nothing more to the press, than what I
    judge absolutely necessary to illustrate it.</p>

  <p>In regard to the natural history of the stones, ‚Äôtis the same as that
    of <i>Stonehenge</i>, which is compos‚Äôd of the very same stones,
    fetch‚Äôd from the same <i>Marlborough-downs</i>, where they lie on the
    surface of the ground in great plenty, of all dimensions. This was
    the occasion, why the Druids took the opportunity of building these
    immense works in this country. The people call these great stones,
    <i>sarsens</i>; and ‚Äôtis a proverb here, <i>as hard as a sarsen</i>;
    a mere <i>ph≈ìnician</i> word, continued here from the first times,
    signifying a <i>rock</i>. The very name of <i>Tyre</i> is hence
    derived, of which largely and learnedly <i>Bochart</i>, <i>Canaan</i>
    II. 10. This whole country, hereabouts, is a solid body of chalk,
    cover‚Äôd with a most delicate turf. As this chalky matter harden‚Äôd at
    creation, it spew‚Äôd out the most solid body of the stones, of greater
    specific gravity than itself; and assisted by the centrifuge power,
    owing to the rotation of the globe upon its axis, threw them upon
    its surface, where they now lie. This is my opinion concerning this
    appearance, which I often attentively consider‚Äôd. ‚ÄôTis worth while
    for a curious observer to go toward the northern end of that great
    ridge of hills overlooking <i>Abury</i> from the east, call‚Äôd the
    <i>Hakpen</i>, an oriental name too, that has continued to it from
    <i>Druid</i> times. A little to the right hand of the road coming from
    <i>Marlborough</i> to <i>Abury</i>, where are three pretty barrows,
    and another dish-like barrow, if we look downwards to the side of
    the hill toward <i>Abury</i>, we discern many long and straight
    ridges of natural stone, the same as the gray weathers, as it were
    emerging out of the chalky surface. They are often cross‚Äôd by others
    in straight lines, almost at right angles. For hereabouts, it seems,
    that the chalk contracting itself, and growing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>closer together, as
    it hardened, thrust the lapidescent matter into these fissures. ‚ÄôTis
    a very pretty appearance. This is near that part of the <i>downs</i>
    call‚Äôd <i>Temple-downs</i>. There are no quarries, properly speaking,
    nearer <i>Abury</i> than <i>Swindon</i>, and those have not long been
    dug. In <i>Caln</i> they dig up a paltry kind of stone, fit for nothing
    but mending the highways. But our gray weather stone is of so hard a
    texture, that Mr. <i>Ayloff</i> of <i>Wooton-basset</i> hewed one of
    them to make a rape-mill stone, and employ‚Äôd twenty yoke of oxen to
    carry it off. Yet so great was its weight, that it repeatedly broke all
    his tackle in pieces, and he was forc‚Äôd to leave it. It may be said of
    many one of our gray weathers,</p>

  <p class="noindent">Lord <i>Pembroke</i> caus‚Äôd several of these stones to be dug under,

    of our stones at above fifty tun, and that it required an hundred yoke
    of oxen to draw one. Dr. <i>Stephen Hales</i> makes the larger kind
    of them to be seventy tun. Mr. <i>Edward Llwyd</i>, in his account of
    the natural history of <i>Wales</i>, <i>Phil. Trans. abridg‚Äôd</i>,

    stones, and loose fragments of rocks on the surface of the earth, not

    So the moor stones on the wastes and hill-tops of <i>Cornwall</i>,

  <p class="clear mt3">As to the internal texture of this stone, when broke, it looks whitish
    like marble. It would bear a pretty good polish, but for a large
    quantity of bluish granules of sand, which are soft, and give it a
    grayish or speckled colour, when smooth‚Äôd by an engine. It consists,
    as all other stones, of a mixture of divers substances, united by
    lapidescent juices, in a sufficient tract of time. Sometimes in one
    stone shall be two or three colours, sometimes bits of flints kneaded
    amongst the rest. In one stone fetch‚Äôd from <i>Bekamton</i> avenue,
    near <i>Longstone barrow</i> (as commonly call‚Äôd) and which was broken
    and made into a wall, at the little alehouse above <i>Bekamton</i>,
    in the <i>Devizes</i> road, I saw several bones, plainly animal,
    part of the composition of the stone. This I admir‚Äôd very much, and
    concluded it to be antediluvian. The stone in general is shining,
    close, and hard, little inferior to common marble; yet the effect
    which time and weather has had upon it, far beyond what is visible at
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, must necessarily make us conclude the work to be
    many hundred years older in date. In some places I could thrust my
    cane, a yard long, up to the handle, in holes and cavities worn through
    by age, which must needs bespeak some thousands of years continuance.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">THE</span> situation of <i>Abury</i> is finely chose for the purpose it was
    destin‚Äôd to, being the more elevated part of a plain, from whence there
    is an almost imperceptible descent every way. But as the religious work
    in <i>Abury</i>, tho‚Äô great in itself, is but a part of the whole,
    (the avenues stretching above a mile from it each way,) the situation
    of the intire design is likewise projected with great judgment, in a
    kind of large, separate plain, four or five miles in diameter. Into
    this you descend on all sides from higher ground. The country north of
    <i>Abury</i>, about <i>Berwick-basset</i> and <i>Broad Hinton</i>, is
    very high, tho‚Äô not appearing so to be, and much above the level of
    <i>Abury</i> town. In a field of <i>Broad Hinton</i> the water runs two
    ways, into the <i>Thames</i> and <i>Severn</i>, and they pretend ‚Äôtis
    the highest ground in <i>England</i>. ‚ÄôTis indeed part of that very
    great ridge of hills, coming from <i>Somersetshire</i>, and going hence
    north-eastward, to the <i>white-horse hill</i>. So that the ground
    northward and westward, tho‚Äô not much appearing so, is still very high,
    a cliff descending that way; and whilst guarded to the east by the
    <i>Hakpen</i>, yet it may be called like the <i>thessalian</i>, of the
    same name,</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The whole temple of <i>Abury</i> may be consider‚Äôd as a picture, and
    it really is so. Therefore the founders wisely contriv‚Äôd, that a
    spectator should have an advantageous prospect of it, as he approach‚Äôd
    within view. To give the reader at once a foreknowledge of this great
    and wonderful work, and the magnificence of the plan upon which it is
    built, I have design‚Äôd it scenographically in <a href="#tab_VIII"><span class="smcap">Table</span> VIII.</a>
    the eye being somewhat more elevated than on the neighbouring hill of
    <i>Wansdike</i>, which is its proper point of sight, being south from
    it.</p>

  <p>When I frequented this place, as I did for some years together, to take
    an exact account of it, staying a fortnight at a time, I found out the
    entire work by degrees. The second time I was here, an avenue was a
    new amusement. The third year another. So that at length I discover‚Äôd
    the mystery of it, properly speaking; which was, that the whole figure
    represented a snake transmitted thro‚Äô a circle; this is an hieroglyphic
    or symbol of highest note and antiquity.</p>

  <p>In order to put this design in execution, the founders well studied
    their ground; and, to make their representation more natural, they
    artfully carry‚Äôd it over a variety of elevations and depressures,
    which, with the curvature of the avenues, produces sufficiently the
    desired effect. To make it still more elegant and picture-like, the
    head of the snake is carried up the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>southern promontory of the
    <i>Hakpen</i> hill, towards the village of <i>West Kennet</i>; nay,
    the very name of the hill is deriv‚Äôd from this circumstance, meaning
    the head of the snake; of which we may well say with <i>Lucan</i>,
    <i>lib.</i> IV.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Again, the tail of the snake is conducted to the descending valley
    below <i>Bekamton</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Thus our antiquity divides itself into three great parts, which will
    be our rule in describing the work. The circle at <i>Abury</i>, the
    fore-part of the snake, leading towards <i>Kennet</i>, which I call
    <i>Kennet-avenue</i>; the hinder part of the snake, leading towards
    <i>Bekamton</i>, which I call <i>Bekamton-avenue</i>; for they may well
    be look‚Äôd on as avenues to the great temple at <i>Abury</i>, which part
    must be more eminently call‚Äôd the temple.</p>

  <p>This town is wrote <i>Aubury</i>, <i>Avebury</i>, <i>Avesbury</i>,
    sometimes <i>Albury</i>: ‚Äôtis hard to say which is the true. The
    former three names may have their origin from the brook running by,
    <i>au</i>, <i>aux</i>, water, <i>awy</i> in <i>welsh</i>; the old
    <i>german</i> <i>aha</i>. The latter points to <i>Aldbury</i>, or
    <i>old work</i>, regarding its situation within the <i>vallum</i>. Nor
    is it worth while to dwell on its etymology; the <i>saxon</i> name is
    a thing of so low a date, in comparison of what we are writing upon,
    that we expect no great use from it; unless <i>Albury</i> has regard
    to <i>al</i>, <i>hal</i>, <i>healle</i>, <i>gothic√®</i> <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/i_019.png" alt="" />
    a <i>temple</i> or <i>great building</i>. There
    are two heads of the river <i>Kennet</i> rising near it: one from a
    little north-west of <i>Abury</i>, at <i>Monkton</i>, runs southward
    to <i>Silbury-hill</i>; this affords but little water, except in wet
    seasons. At <i>Silbury-hill</i> it joins the <i>Swallow</i> head, or
    true fountain of the <i>Kennet</i>, which the country people call
    by the old name, <i>Cunnit</i>; and it is not a little famous among
    them. This is a plentiful spring. It descends between <i>east</i> and
    <i>west Kennet</i>, by the temple on <i>Overton-hill</i>, which is
    properly the head of the snake: it passes by <i>Overton</i>, and so to
    <i>Marlborough</i>, the <i>roman</i> <i>Cunetio</i>, which has its name
    from the river.</p>

  <p>To conduct the reader the better through this great work, I must
    remind him of what I wrote in the account of <i>Stonehenge</i>, p. 11,
    concerning the Druid cubit or measure, by which they erected all their
    structures, that ‚Äôtis 20 inches and four fifths of the <i>english</i>
    standard. For this purpose I have repeated the <a href="#tab_II">plate</a>
    wherein the <i>english</i> foot and Druid cubit is compar‚Äôd to any lengths, which
    must necessarily accompany us in the description. A ready way of having
    the analogism between our feet and the cubits is this, 3 foot 5 inches
    and a half makes 2 cubits. A staff of 10 foot, 4 inches, and a little
    more than half an inch, becomes the measuring-reed of these ancient
    philosophers, being 6 cubits, when they laid out the ground-plot of
    these temples; where we now are to pursue the track of their footsteps
    which so many ages have pass‚Äôd over.</p>

  <p>The whole of this temple, wherein the town of <i>Abury</i> is included
    I have laid down in <a href="#tab_I"><span class="smcap">Table</span> I</a>, the frontispiece, done from
    innumerable mensurations, by which means I fully learn‚Äôd the scheme
    and purport of the founders. ‚ÄôTis comprehended within a circular ditch
    or trench above 1400 foot in diameter, which makes 800 cubits, being
    two <i>stadia</i> of the ancients. A <i>radius</i> of 400 cubits, one
    <i>stadium</i>, struck the inner periphery of the ditch, in the turf.
    This is done with a sufficient, tho‚Äô not a mathematical exact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>ness.
    They were not careful in this great measure, where preciseness would
    have no effect, seeing the whole circle cannot be taken in by the eye
    on the same level. The ditch is near 80 foot, which is 45 cubits broad,
    very deep, like the foss that encompasses an old castle. The great
    quantity of solid chalk dug out of it, is thrown on the outside, where
    it forms a mighty <i>vallum</i>, an amphitheatrical terrace, which
    hides the sight of the town as we come near it, and affords a good
    shelter from the winds. ‚ÄôTis of the same breadth at bottom as the ditch
    at top. The compass of this, on the outside, Mr. <i>Roger Gale</i> and
    I measured about 4800 feet, <i>August 16, 1721</i>.</p>

  <p>The included <i>area</i> of the temple containing about 22 acres, I
    observ‚Äôd to have a gentle descent, from the meridian line of it to the
    east, and to the west: carrying the rain off both ways. The north point
    is the highest part of the whole. About 35 feet or 20 cubits within the
    verge of this circular ditch, is a great circle of <i>great</i> stones.
    The epithet may well be redoubled. These great masses are really
    astonishing, if we contemplate a single stone, and consider how it was
    brought hither, and set upright in the ground, where it has stood, I
    doubt not, 3 or 4 thousand years. But how is the wonder heightened,
    when we see the number one hundred, which composes this mighty circle
    of 1300 foot diameter! The stones of this circle, tho‚Äô unhewn, are
    generally about 15, 16, or 17 foot high, and near as much in breadth.
    About 43 <i>English</i> feet, measures regularly from the center of
    one stone, to the center of the other. Look into the scale and we
    discern these measures of the height and breadth of the stones. 17
    feet is ten cubits; 43 feet the central distance from stone to stone,
    is 25 cubits of the Druids; so that the interval between is 15 cubits.
    Tho‚Äô this be the general and stated measure, which was proposed by the
    founders, where the stones suited, and of the largest dimensions, yet
    we must understand this, as in all their works, with some latitude. The
    ancients studied a certain greatness: to produce an effect, not by a
    servile exactness no way discernible in great works, but in securing
    the general beauty; especially we must affirm this of our Druids,
    who had to do with these unshapely masses, and where religion forbad
    them applying a tool. But the purpose they proposed, was to make the
    breadth of the stone to the interval, to be as two to three. They very
    wisely judg‚Äôd that in such materials, where the scantlings could not
    be exact, the proportions must still be adjusted agreeable to their
    diversities, and this both in respect of the particulars, and of the
    general distance to be filled up. These stones were all fetched from
    the surface of the downs. They took the most shapely, and of largest
    dimensions first; but when ‚Äôtwas necessary to make use of lesser
    stones, they set them closer together, and so proportion‚Äôd the solid
    and the vacuity, as gave symmetry in appearance, and a regularity to
    the whole.</p>

  <p>Therefore tho‚Äô 25 cubits be the common measure of the interval between
    center and center of the largest stones of this circle, yet this is not
    always the rule; for if we measure the two stones west of the north
    entrance (which entrance was made for the convenience of the town, by
    throwing the earth of the <i>vallum</i> into it again) you will find
    it to be about 27 feet. This is but 16 of the Druid cubits, and here
    us‚Äôd, because these stones are but of moderate bulk. The next intervals
    are 43 feet as usual, being of the larger kind of stones, so plac‚Äôd 25
    cubits central distance, and then they proceed. This is in that call‚Äôd
    pasture IIII. in the ground plot.</p>

  <p>I have always been at first in some perplexity in measuring and
    adjusting these works of the Druids, and they seem‚Äôd magical, ‚Äôtill
    I became master <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>of their purpose. Therefore to make it very plain
    to the reader, I shall repeat what I have deliver‚Äôd in other words,
    concerning this great circle, which is a general rule for all others.</p>

  </div>

  <p>As to the construction of this circle, by diligent observation, I found
    this to be the art of the Druids. ‚ÄôTis not to be thought, they would
    be at the trouble of bringing so many mountains together, of placing
    them in a regular form, without seeking how to produce the best effect
    therein, and thus they obtain‚Äôd their purpose. As it was necessary, the
    stones should be rude and native, untouch‚Äôd of tool, and that it was
    impossible to procure them of the dimensions exactly; they consider‚Äôd
    that the beauty in their appearance must be owing to their conformity,
    as near as may be, and to the proportion between the solid and the
    void interval. This <i>ratio</i> with judgment they chose to be as two
    to three: two parts the breadth of the stone, the interval three. And
    this they accommodated to the whole circle. So that they first brought
    100 of their choicest stones together, and laid them in the destin‚Äôd
    circle, at the intended distances, according to that proportion: and
    then raised them into their respective places.</p>

  <p>Hence I find, that where the stones are 15, 16, or 17 feet high above
    ground, and as much broad, as for the most part they are, about 43
    <i>English</i> feet measures, from the center of one stone to the
    center of another; there the square of the solid or stone is ten
    cubits, the void or interval is 15: the whole central distance 25.
    Therefore the proportion of the solid to the void is as two to three.</p>

  <p>But before I found out this key to the work, I met with a good deal of
    difficulty, because the central intervals and the voids were different,
    for they proportion‚Äôd these to the breadths of the stones, as above.
    Still they chose whole numbers of cubits for that proportion; for
    instance, in the stones at the northern and modern entrance, where
    they are but of a moderate bulk, you measure but about 27 feet central
    distance. This is 16 cubits.</p>

  <p>Further I observ‚Äôd, they took care to make a reasonable gradation,
    between greater and lesser stones, not to set a great stone and a
    little one near one another, but make a gradual declension; by this
    means in the whole, the eye finds no difference. The proportion of
    solid and void being the same, the whole circle appears similar and
    altogether pleasing.</p>

  <p>I thought it adviseable to give a <a href="#tab_XII">plate</a>
    of a very small part of this magnificent circle, being 3 stones now standing <i>in situ</i>. ‚ÄôTis a
    most august sight, and whence we may learn somewhat of the appearance
    of the whole.</p>

  <p>I observ‚Äôd further, that as these stones generally have a rough and
    a smoother side; they took care to place the most sightly side of
    the stone inwards, toward the included <i>area</i>. For this vast
    circle of stones is to be understood, as the portico inclosing the
    temple properly. Between this circle and the ditch is an esplanade
    or circular walk quite round, which was extraordinary pretty when
    in its perfection. It was originally 25 cubits broad, equal to the
    central distances of the stones. The quickset hedges now on the place,
    sometimes take the range of the stones, sometimes are set on the verge
    of the ditch. Further I observ‚Äôd they set the largest and handsomest
    stones in the more conspicuous part of the temple, which is that
    southward, and about the two entrances of the avenues.</p>

  <p>Out of this noble circle of stones 100 in number, there was left in the
    year 1722, when I began to write, above 40 still visible: whereof 17
    were standing, 27 thrown down or reclining. Ten of the remainder all
    contiguous, were at once destroy‚Äôd by <i>Tom Robinson</i>, <i>anno</i>
    1700, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> places perfectly levelled, for the sake of the
    pasturage. In the north entrance of the town one of the stones, of a
    most enormous bulk, fell down, and broke in the fall.</p>

    And when my late lord <i>Winchelsea</i> (<i>Heneage</i>) was here with
    me, we saw three wooden wedges driven into it, in order to break it in
    pieces.</p>

  <p>In the great <a href="#tab_I">frontispiece plate</a>, I have noted many dates of years, when
    such and such stones were demolished, and took down the particulars of
    all: some are still left buried in the pastures, some in gardens. I was

    stupendous bulk, set in a nich-like figure. A short history of
    the destroyers of this noble work, but a very few years ago.</i>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">THE</span> great circle of stones last described, together with the ditch and
    rampart inclosing all, may be esteemed as the <i>pr√¶cinctus</i> of the
    temple, not properly the temple; but including the area thereof. There
    are strictly within this great compass, two temples, of like form and
    dimensions: each temple consists of two concentric circles. The line
    that connects their centers, runs from north-west to south-east: which
    line passes thro‚Äô the center of the whole area. The outer circles
    of them consist each of 30 stones of like dimensions with those of
    the outer circle, and at like intervals. The inner circles of both
    consist each of 12 stones, of the same size and distances. The geometry
    therefore of them, when laid down on paper, shews, the inner circle
    must be 100 cubits in diameter, the outer 240.</p>

  <p>The centers of these two double circles are 300 cubits asunder. Their
    circumferences or outward circles are 50 cubits asunder, in the nearest
    part. By which means they least embarrass each other, and leave the
    freest space about ‚Äôem, within the great circular portico (as we may
    call it) inclosing the whole; which we described in the former chapter.
    There is no other difference between these two temples (properly)
    which I could discover, save that one, the southermost, has a central
    obelisc, which was the kibla, whereto they turn‚Äôd their faces, in the
    religious offices there performed: the other has that immense work in
    the center, which the old <i>Britons</i> call a cove: consisting of
    three stones plac‚Äôd with an obtuse angle toward each other, and as
    it were, upon an ark of a circle, like the great half-round at the
    east end of some old cathedrals: or like the upper end of the cell at
    <i>Stonehenge</i>; being of the same use and intent, the <i>adytum</i>
    of this temple. This I have often times admir‚Äôd and been astonish‚Äôd at
    its extravagant magnitude and majesty. It stands in the yard belonging
    to the inn. King <i>Charles</i> II. in his progress this way, rode into
    the yard, on purpose to view it.</p>

  <p>This cove of the northern temple was undoubtedly the <i>kibla</i>
    thereof. It opens pretty exactly north-east, as at <i>Stonehenge</i>.
    It measures 34 foot, from the edge of the outer jambs; 20 cubits: and
    half as much in depth. <i>Varro</i> V. <i>divinorum</i>, writes, altars
    were of old call‚Äôd <i>ans√¶</i>. So <i>Macrobius saturn.</i> II. 11. It
    seems that they mean this figure before us. And I suppose ‚Äôtis what
    <i>Schedius</i> means; <i>de dis germ.</i> c. 25. speaking of altars
    among the old <i>germans</i> set in a triangle, he says, the Druids
    understood a mystery thereby. Perhaps they intended it for a nich-like
    hemispherical figure, in some sort to represent the heavens. <i>Sex.
    Pompeius</i> writes, the ancients<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
    called the heavens, <i>cove</i>.
    The altar properly lay upon the ground before this superb nich. That,
    no doubt, was carry‚Äôd off long ago, as not being fix‚Äôd in the earth,
    and one of the wings is gone too, the northern. It fell down 1713, as
    marked in the ground-plot.</p>

  <p>They told me it was full seven yards long, of the same shape as its
    opposite, tall and narrow. We measur‚Äôd this 17 foot above ground,
    10 whole cubits; 7 foot broad, two and a half thick. These were the
    <i>ans√¶</i> or wings of this noble ellipsis. That on the back, or in
    the middle, is much broader, being 15 foot, as many high, 4 thick; but
    a great piece of one side of it has been broke off by decay of the
    stone. We cannot conceive any thing bolder, than the idea of those
    people that entertain‚Äôd a design of setting up these stones. The vulgar
    call them the <i>devil‚Äôs brand-irons</i>, from their extravagant
    bulk, and chimney-like form. These coves, as <i>Maundrel</i> says of
    the <i>turkish kiblas</i>, shew the Druids‚Äô aversion to idolatry,
    expressing the reality of the divine presence there, and at the same
    time its invisibility; no doubt a most ancient and oriental custom.</p>

  <p>Of the exterior circle of this northern temple but three stones are now
    left standing, six more lying on the ground, one whereof in the street
    by the inn-gate. People yet alive remember several standing in the
    middle of the street; they were burnt for building, <i>anno</i> 1711.
    That at the corner of the lane, going to the north gate of the town,
    not many years since lying on the ground, was us‚Äôd as a stall to lay
    fish on, when they had a kind of market here. The ruin of the rest is
    noted in the ground-plot, and so of the others. But they told us, that
    about a dozen years ago both circles were standing, and almost entire.
    Those in the closes behind the inn, were taken up a year ago; (this was
    when I first went thither, about 1718,) farmer <i>Green</i> chiefly
    demolished them to build his house and walls at <i>Bekamton</i>. Of
    the southern temple several stones were destroy‚Äôd by farmer <i>John
    Fowler</i>, twelve years ago; he own‚Äôd to us that he burnt five of
    them; but fourteen are still left, whereof about half standing. Some
    lie along in the pastures, two let into the ground under a barn, others
    under the houses. One lies above ground under the corner of a house,
    over-against the inn. One buried under the earth in a little garden.
    The cavities left by some more are visible, in the places whereof
    ash-trees are set. All those in the pastures were standing within
    memory.</p>

  <p>The central obelisk of this temple is of a circular form at base, of a
    vast bulk, 21 feet long, and 8 feet 9 inches diameter; when standing,
    higher than the rest. This is what the scripture calls a pillar, or
    standing image, <i>Levit.</i> xxvi. 1. These works, erected in the land
    of <i>Canaan</i> by the same people, the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>, as erected
    ours, were ordered to be demolished by the <i>Israelites</i>, because
    at that time perverted to idolatry. All the stones, our whole temple,
    were called <i>ambres</i>, even by our <i>ph≈ìnician</i> founders; but
    this particularly. The <i>Egyptians</i> by that name call‚Äôd their
    obeliscs; which <i>Kircher</i> did not rightly understand, interpreting
    it to be sacred books; but meaning <i>petr√¶ ambrosi√¶</i>, <i>main
    ambres in celtic, anointed, consecrated stone</i>; <i>Manah</i>,
    the name of a great stone of this sort which the <i>Arabians</i>
    worshipped. They were called likewise, <i>gabal</i>, and the present
    word <i>kibla</i> or <i>kebla</i> comes from it, but in a larger
    sense. <i>Elagabalus</i> is hence deriv‚Äôd after they turn‚Äôd these
    <i>kiblas</i> into real deities. It means the <i>god obe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>lisc</i>;
    and hence our <i>english</i> words, <i>gable end</i> of a house,
    <i>javelin</i> or <i>roman pile</i>, and <i>gaveloc</i> a <i>sharp iron
    bar</i>.</p>

  <p>Exactly in the southern end of the line that connects the two centers
    of these temples, <i>viz.</i> in that pasture mark‚Äôd IX. in our
    ground-plot, is an odd stone standing, not of great bulk. It has a hole
    wrought in it, and probably was design‚Äôd to fasten the victim, in order
    for slaying it. This I call the <i>ring-stone</i>. From this we may
    infer the like use of that stone at <i>Stonehenge</i>, in the avenue
    near the entrance into the area of the temple. I spoke of it under the
    name of <i>crwm leche</i>, p. 33. It has a like hole in it.</p>

  <p>These two temples were all that was standing originally in the great
    area, within the circular colonnade. Very probably it was the most
    magnificent patriarchal temple in the world. Now a whole village of
    about thirty houses is built within it. This area would hold an immense
    number of people at their panegyres and public festivals; and when the
    <i>vallum</i> all around was cover‚Äôd with spectators, it form‚Äôd a most
    noble amphitheater, and had an appearance extremely august, during the
    administration of religious offices.</p>

    exercis‚Äôd this at first on one of the stones standing in the street
    before the inn, belonging to the outer circle of the southern temple.
    That one stone, containing 20 loads, built the dining-room end of the
    inn. Since then <i>Tom Robinson</i>, another <i>Herostratus</i> of the
    place, made cruel havock among them. He own‚Äôd to us, that two of them
    cost eight pounds in the execution. Farmer <i>Green</i> ruin‚Äôd many of
    the southern temple to build his houses and walls at <i>Bekamton</i>.
    Since then many others have occasionally practis‚Äôd the sacrilegious
    method, and most of the houses, walls, and outhouses in the town
    are raised from these materials. Sir <i>Robert Holford</i> resented
    this destruction of them; and <i>Reuben Horsall</i>, parish-clerk,
    had a due veneration for these sacred remains, and assisted me in
    the best intelligence he was able to give. Concerning the purport of
    the disposition and manner of the temple hitherto described, I shall

    exhibits a view of it from the present road to <i>Bath</i> and <i>Devizes</i>, and at
    the same time affords us a demonstration that our Druid antiquities,
    which we are here describing, are prior in time to these works of the
    <i>Romans</i>. This way is not compos‚Äôd, as they generally are, of
    materials fetch‚Äôd from a distance, made into a high bank, but only a
    small ridge of chalk dug up all along close by. We discern upon the
    heath the little pits or cavities, on both sides, whence it was taken
    to make the ridge of the road. For this road is not finished, though
    mentioned in <i>Antoninus‚Äôs itinerary</i>, journey XIV, only chalk‚Äôd
    out, as we may properly say. Moreover, the workmen for readiness, have
    par‚Äôd off above half of a sepulchral barrow on the right hand, of a
    very finely turn‚Äôd bell-like form, to make use of the earth; and there
    is a discontinuance of the line of the little cavities there for some
    time, till it was not worth while any longer to fetch materials from
    it. And on the left hand they have made two of their little pits or
    cavities within the ditch of a Druid‚Äôs barrow (as I call them) and
    quite dug away the prominent part of the barrow, consisting of a little
    tump over the urn, inclos‚Äôd with the circular ditch of a much larger
    dimension. This observation is of a like nature with that of <a href="#tab_IV">Plate
    IV.</a> of <i>Stonehenge</i>. It must be noted, that this <i>roman</i>
    road here, being mark‚Äôd out only; I suppose it was done toward the
    declension of their empire here, when they found not time to finish it.</p>

  <p>I could well enough discern from which point the <i>roman</i>
    workmen carry‚Äôd this way, by observing the discontinuity of these
    little pits, on account of the materials they took from the larger
    barrow, <i>viz.</i> from <i>Cunetio Marlborough</i>, to <i>Verlucio
    Hedington</i>, and so to <i>Bath</i>.</p>

  <p>This road, as it goes farther on, and passes to the other side
    of <i>Runway-hill</i> (<i>Roman-way hill</i>) gives us two other
    remarkable appearances, both which are seen in <a href="#tab_X">Plate X.</a> which I have
    repeated again in this book, to which it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>more properly belongs.
    It serves to rectify our notions concerning the high antiquity of
    the temple we are writing upon. 1. We discern the artifice of the
    <i>roman</i> workmen, in conducing their road along the precipicious
    side of this hill, and preserving at the same time the straight line,
    as much as may be. 2. We see a part of the famous <i>Wansdike</i>,
    or boundary of the <i>belgic</i> kingdom in <i>Britain</i>, drawn
    under their king <i>Divitiacus</i>, spoken of by <i>C√¶sar</i>
    in his <i>commentaries</i>. He built the neighbouring town, the
    <i>Devizes</i>, so call‚Äôd from his name, and most probably the city
    of his residence. I treated of this matter in <i>Stonehenge</i>. 3.
    We may remark the union of the <i>roman</i> road and <i>Wansdike</i>,
    for some space, and a proof that <i>Wansdike</i> was made before this
    <i>roman</i> road, because the bank of the dike is thrown in, in order
    to form the road. <i>C√¶sar</i> says, this <i>Divitiacus</i>, king of
    the <i>Suessions</i> in <i>Gaul</i>, lived an age before him.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of this hill is <i>Hedington</i>, another <i>roman</i>
    town, call‚Äôd <i>Verlucio</i>. <i>Calne</i>, less than five mile off
    <i>Abury</i>, was a <i>roman</i> town too, where many <i>roman</i>
    coins are found. Several of them I saw. Hence, the <i>romans</i> being
    very frequent in this country, ‚Äôtis no wonder their coins are found
    about <i>Abury</i>. I think I may well be excus‚Äôd from entering into
    a formal argumentation to prove that we must not hence gather, the
    <i>Romans</i> were founders of <i>Abury</i>. In my own opinion, who
    have duly consider‚Äôd these affairs, the temple of the Druids here is as
    much older than the <i>roman</i> times, as since the <i>Romans</i> to
    our own time.</p>

  <p>Return we down <i>Runway-hill</i>, and contemplate that most agreeable
    prospect, of which I have given a faint representation in <a href="#tab_XI">Plate XI.</a>
    We see here the whole course of this <i>Via Badonica</i> hence,
    in a straight line to <i>Marlborough</i>, by <i>Silbury-hill</i>,
    the great tomb of the founder of <i>Abury</i>. I saw several
    <i>roman</i> coins found about this road on <i>Overton-hill</i>,
    near the <i>white-hart</i> alehouse. On the left hand is the strong
    <i>roman</i> camp of <i>Oldbury</i>. Every where we behold great
    numbers of the barrows of the old <i>Britons</i>, regarding the temple
    of <i>Abury</i>. On the right hand we may discern a vast length of the
    <i>Wansdike</i>, carried along the northern edge of the high range of
    hills parting north and south <i>Wiltshire</i>. Below is a pretty work
    like a <i>roman</i> camp, cut in the fine turf. It should seem to be
    somewhat belonging to the Druids, of which afterwards.</p>

  <p>Beside some <i>roman</i> coins accidentally found in and about
    <i>Abury</i>, I was inform‚Äôd of a square bit of iron taken up
    under one of the great stones, upon pulling it down. I could not
    learn particularly what it was, tho‚Äô no doubt it belonged to the
    <i>British</i> founders. They found likewise a brass ax-head, under
    an ash-tree dug up near the smith‚Äôs shop by the church. I understood,
    by the description they gave of it, it was one of those Druid axes
    or instruments call‚Äôd <i>Celts</i>, wherewith they cut the misletoe,
    fastening it occasionally on the end of the staff, which they commonly
    carry‚Äôd in their hands, one of the <i>insignia</i> of their office, as
    a pastoral staff of bishops.</p>

  <p>When the lord <i>Stowell</i>, who own‚Äôd the manor of <i>Abury</i>,
    levell‚Äôd the <i>vallum</i> on that side of the town next the church,
    where the barn now stands, the workmen came to the original surface of
    the ground, which was easily discernible by a black <i>stratum</i> of
    mold upon the chalk. Here they found large quantities of bucks‚Äô horns,
    bones, oyster-shells, and wood coals. The old man who was employ‚Äôd in
    the work says, there was the quantity of a cart-load of the horns, that
    they were very rotten, that there were very many burnt bones among
    them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

  <p>They were remains of the sacrifices that had been perform‚Äôd here;
    probably before the temple was quite finish‚Äôd, and the ditch made.
    These are all the antiquities I could learn to have been found in and
    about the town of <i>Abury</i>.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">THE</span> Druids, by throwing outwards the earth dug out of the huge circular
    ditch environing the town, demonstrated to all comers at first sight,
    that this was a place of religion, not a camp or castle of defence.
    They prevented its ever being us‚Äôd as such, which must have ruin‚Äôd
    their sacred design. Moreover it adds to the solemnity of the place; it
    gives an opportunity for a greater number of people to assist at the
    offices of religion.</p>

  <p>This further great convenience attends the disposition of ditch and
    <i>vallum</i>, that the water falls off the <i>area</i> every way,
    and keeps it dry, which provides for the stability of their work, and
    convenience of the priests in their ministry. I observ‚Äôd the earth that
    composes the <i>vallum</i> was laid a small distance from the verge of
    the ditch, so as to leave a parapet or narrow walk between. This was as
    the <i>podium</i> of an amphitheater, for the lower tire of spectators.
    The ditch and rampart are each 60 feet, or 35 cubits broad. And now the
    whole is an agreeable terrace-walk round the town, with a pleasant view
    upon sometimes corn-fields, sometimes heath; the hill-tops every where
    cover‚Äôd with barrows; and that amazing artificial heap of earth call‚Äôd
    <i>Silbury-hill</i> in sight. The great <i>belgic</i> rampart, the
    <i>Wansdike</i>, licks all the southern horizon, as far as you can see
    it, crowning the upper edge of that range of hills parting <i>north</i>
    and <i>south Wiltshire</i>. Part of this pleasant prospect I have given
    in <a href="#tab_XXIII">plate XXIII</a>,
    as seen from <i>Abury</i> church-steeple.</p>

  <p>Let us then walk out of the confines of the temple properly, by the
    southern entrance of the town. Passing the <i>vallum</i>, the road
    straight forwards leads to <i>Kennet</i> and <i>Overton</i>, that on
    the right hand to the <i>Bath</i>. But our present way lies straight
    forwards, which is south-eastward, and may properly enough be call‚Äôd
    <i>Via sacra</i>, as being an avenue up to the temple; besides, it
    forms one half of the body of the snake, issuing out of the circle.
    There were but two gates or entrances into the temple originally; this
    was one. And this way I call <a href="#tab_XVIII"><i>Kennet-avenue</i></a>.</p>

  <p>By repeated mensurations, by careful attention and observations,
    by frequently walking along the whole track thereof, from one end
    to the other, I found out its purpose, its extent, the number of
    stones it is compos‚Äôd of, and the measures of their intervals. It
    extends itself from this southern entrance of <i>Abury</i> town to
    <i>Overton-hill</i>, overhanging the village of <i>West-Kennet</i>.
    <i>There</i> was another double circle of stones, which made the head
    of the snake. All the way between there, and this southern entrance,
    which is above a mile, was set with stones on each hand, opposite to
    one another, and at regular distances. This was the avenue, and form‚Äôd
    the forepart of the snake.</p>

  <p>The Druids, in laying down this design, that it might produce a
    magnificent effect suitable to so great and operose a work, studied the
    thing well. As this was to be a huge picture or representation of an
    animal, they purposed to follow nature‚Äôs drawing, as far as possible. A
    snake‚Äôs body has some variation in its thickness, as slenderer toward
    the neck, than at its middle. This the Druids imitated in making the
    avenue broader toward this southern entrance of <i>Abury</i>; and
    drawing it narrower as it approached <i>Overton-hill</i>. Again, when a
    snake is represented in its sinuous motion, the intervals of the stones
    sideways must have a variation, as set in the inner or the outer curve;
    so as to make them stand regularly opposite to one another: yet this
    necessarily makes some little difference in the intervals, and this too
    is properly regarded in the work.</p>

  <p>The whole length of this avenue consists of a hundred stones on each
    side, reaching from the <i>vallum</i> of <i>Abury</i> town, to the
    circular work on <i>Overton-hill</i>. Measuring the breadth of it in
    several places where I had an opportunity of two opposite stones being
    left, I found a difference; and the like by measuring the interval of
    stones sideways; yet there was the same proportion preserved between
    breadth and interval; which I found to be as two to three. So that
    here by <i>Abury</i>-town, in a part that represented the belly of the
    snake, the breadth of the avenue was 34 cubits, 56 feet and a half,
    and the intervals of the stones sideways 50 cubits, the proportion of
    two to three; twice 17 being 34, thrice 17 50. These 34 cubits take
    in the intire space of two intervals of the stones of the outer great
    circle of the temple of <i>Abury</i> within the ditch, together with
    the intermediate stone, which is the entry of the avenue to the temple.
    A most ancient manner, a double door with a pillar in the middle. Such
    was that of the <i>Mosaick</i> tabernacle: and such very often of our
    cathedrals. When we mount up <i>Overton-hill</i>, the avenue grows
    much narrower. And this observation help‚Äôd me in the discovery of the
    purport and design of the whole figure of the snake; and in the nature
    of the scheme thereof. Of which wonderful work we may well say with the
    poet; elsewhere,</p>

  <p>When I abode here for some time on purpose, for several summers
    together; I was very careful in tracing it out, knew the distinct
    number of each stone remaining, and where every one stood that was
    wanting; which often surpriz‚Äôd the country people, who remembred them
    left on the ground or standing, and told me who carried them away. Many
    of the farmers made deep holes and buried them in the ground: they
    knew where they lay. Lord <i>Winchelsea</i> with me counted the number
    of the stones left, 72,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> <i>anno</i> 1722. I laid it all down in the
    nature of a survey, on large imperial sheets of paper, and wrote a
    detail of every stone present, or absent. But it would be very irksome
    to load the press with it. I shall recite no more of it, than what I
    think most useful and necessary.</p>

  <p>Standing at the southern entrance of <i>Abury</i>, one stone the first,
    lies on the eastern side or left hand, close by the ditch: its opposite
    stood where at present a sycamore tree is planted. The next stone on
    the right hand is standing, by the turning of the <i>Bath</i>-road.
    Twenty four stones on both sides, next following, are carried off. At
    about 20 intervals going along the road to <i>Kennet</i>, which is the
    same as the avenue, we descend a gentle valley, and then lose sight
    of <i>Abury</i>. There you discern the curving of the avenue, many
    stones being left together on both sides. Here two stones are standing
    opposite to each other. I measur‚Äôd them near 60 feet asunder, which is
    34 cubits. Then we ascend again a little hillock, where a good number
    of stones remain on both sides.</p>

  <p>In a close on the left hand of the avenue, or east of it, not far from
    <i>Abury</i> town, is a pentagonal stone laid flat on the ground, in
    the middle of which is a bason cut, always full of water, and never
    overflowing. The country people have a great regard to it: it proceeds
    from a spring underneath, and for ought I know, it may have been here
    from the foundation of our temple. Coming out of <i>Abury</i>, you
    observe the line of the <a href="#tab_XIX">avenue</a> regards <i>Overton-hill</i> before you,
    but soon you find it leaves it, and curves to the right hand a little.
    At the number of 65 stones on each side, you come to a hedge belonging
    to the inclosures of <i>West-Kennet</i>. In the year 1720 I saw
    several stones just taken up there, and broke for building; fragments
    still remaining and their places fresh turf‚Äôd over, for the sake of
    pasturage. Where the corn-fields or pasturage have infring‚Äôd upon
    the sacred ground, our work generally goes to wreck. Where the heath
    remains, ‚Äôtis still perfect enough; of which we say with the great poet,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0"><i>Nec nulla interea est inarat√¶ gratia terr√¶.</i></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">so that the covetous farmer and grazier have conspired to abolish this
    most magnificent monument; and that just about the time I was there.
    <i>Charles Tucker</i> Esq; late of <i>East-Kennet</i> a gentleman of
    sense, us‚Äôd to be very angry at the ruin of these stones, and prevented
    it as much as he could.</p>

  <p>As to the stones that compos‚Äôd this avenue, they were of all shapes,
    sizes, and height that happen‚Äôd, altogether rude. Some we measur‚Äôd 6
    feet thick, 16 in circumference. If of a flattish make, the broadest
    dimension was set in the line of the avenue, and the most sightly
    side of the stone inward. The founders were sensible, all the effect
    desired in the case, was their bulk and regular station. All the
    hill tops, especially the <i>Hakpen</i>, are adorn‚Äôd with barrows as
    we go along. When the avenue comes to the inclosures aforementioned
    of <i>West-Kennet</i>, it passes through three of them, crosses a
    little field lane, and the common road from <i>Marlborough</i> to
    <i>Bath</i>, just after the road makes a right angle descending
    from <i>Overton-hill</i>. We must note that we have been a good
    while ascending again. In this angle the <i>Roman</i>-road from
    <i>Marlborough</i> coming down the hill, enters the common road. This
    is the <i>via Badonica</i> aforementioned.</p>

  <p><i>John Fowler</i>, who kept the alehouse hard by, demolish‚Äôd many of
    these stones by burning. The alehouse (the <i>white hart</i>) and the
    walls about it, were built out of one stone.</p>

  <p>As before, the avenue coming out of <i>Abury</i> town bended itself to
    the right, now ‚Äôtis easily enough discernible, that it makes a mighty
    curve to the left, the better to imitate the creature it‚Äôs intended for.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Passing the <i>Roman</i> road, it traverses an angle of a pasture, and
    falls into the upper part of the same road again, and marches through
    two more pastures, all along the quickset hedge-side: so that the quick
    is planted in the very middle of it. Many of the stones are seen lying
    in their proper places, both in the pastures and in the road. These
    stones are all thrown down or reclining, and very large. We measur‚Äôd
    one by the style 12 feet long, 6 and a half broad, 3 and a half thick.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of these pastures on the right, runs the virgin stream of
    <i>Kennet</i>, just parted from its fountain by <i>Silbury-hill</i>.
    One stone is still standing by a little green lane going down to
    the river. Now our avenue marches directly up the hill, across some
    plough‚Äôd fields, still by the hedge of the <i>Marlborough</i> road,
    where yet stands another stone belonging to it. Then we are brought
    to the very summit of the celebrated <i>Overton-hill</i>, properly
    the <i>Hakpen</i> or head of the snake, which is 7000 feet from
    the <i>vallum</i> of <i>Abury</i> town. 400 cubits, according to
    <i>Herodotus</i> II, was the <i>stadium</i> of the ancients, our
    furlong; a space that <i>Hercules</i> is said to run over at one
    breath. Had the side-interval of the stones of this avenue been the
    same throughout, 50 cubits, that repeated 100 times the number of the
    intervals, would produce 5000 cubits. But because, as I said, they
    lessen‚Äôd this interval proportionably, as they came to the neck of
    the snake, it amounts to 4000 cubits, which is ten <i>stadia</i>, an
    eastern mile in Dr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>‚Äôs tables, amounting to 7000 feet,
    as Mr. <i>Roger Gale</i> and I measur‚Äôd its whole length.</p>

  <p>We may observe the proportion between the diameter of the great circle
    of <i>Abury</i> town, which was 800 cubits, two <i>stadia</i>, and the
    length of the avenue, which is five times the other. Observe farther,
    they carry‚Äôd the avenue up the side of the hill, so sloping as to make
    the ascent gradual and easy.</p>

  <p>This <a href="#tab_XX"><i>Overton-hill</i></a>, from time immemorial, the country-people
    have a high notion of. It was (alas, it was!) a very few years ago,
    crown‚Äôd with a most beautiful temple of the Druids. They still call it
    the sanctuary. I doubt not but it was an <i>asylum</i> in Druid times;
    and the veneration for it has been handed down thro‚Äô all succession
    of times and people, as the name, and as several other particulars,
    that will occasionally be mention‚Äôd. It had suffer‚Äôd a good deal
    when I took that prospect of it, with great fidelity, <i>anno</i>
    1723, which I give the reader in <a href="#tab_XXI">plate XXI</a>.
    Then, about sixteen years
    ago, farmer <i>Green</i> aforemention‚Äôd took most of the stones away
    to his buildings at <i>Bekamton</i>; and in the year 1724 farmer
    <i>Griffin</i> plough‚Äôd half of it up. But the vacancy of every stone
    was most obvious, the hollows still left fresh; and that part of the
    two circles which I have drawn in the plate, was exactly as I have
    represented it. In the winter of that year the rest were all carry‚Äôd
    off, and the ground plough‚Äôd over.</p>

  <p>The loss of this work I did not lament alone; but all the neighbours
    (except the person that gain‚Äôd the little dirty profit) were heartily
    griev‚Äôd for it. It had a beauty that touch‚Äôd them far beyond those
    much greater circles in <i>Abury</i> town. The stones here were not
    large, set pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> close together, the proportions of them with the
    intervals, and the proportions between the two circles, all being taken
    at one view, under the eye, charm‚Äôd them. The great stones of the great
    circles at <i>Abury</i> were not by them discern‚Äôd to stand in circles,
    nor would they easily be persuaded of it. But these of the sanctuary
    they still talk of with great pleasure and regret.</p>

  <p>This <i>Overton-hill</i>, whereon was the elegant temple we are
    speaking of, is a very pleasant place. ‚ÄôTis the southern end of that
    ridge call‚Äôd the <i>Hakpen</i>, broken off by the river <i>Kennet</i>.
    All the water that falls in that plain wherein the whole work of
    <i>Abury</i> stands, descends this way. It is a round knoll with a
    gentle declivity to the east, west, and south. The <i>Kennet</i>, as it
    were, licks its feet on all those sides. The whole hill has its name
    from this end.</p>

  <p>To our name of <i>Hakpen</i> alludes <span lang="he">◊ê◊ó◊ô◊ù</span> <i>ochim</i> call‚Äôd
    <i>doleful creatures</i> in our translation, <i>Isaiah</i> xiii. 21.
    speaking of the desolation of <i>Babylon</i>, ‚ÄúWild beasts of the
    desert shall lie there, and their houses shall be full of <i>ochim</i>,
    and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.‚Äù St.
    <i>Jerom</i> translates it serpents. The <i>Arabians</i> call a
    serpent, <i>Haie</i>; and wood-serpents, <i>Hageshin</i>; and thence
    our <i>Hakpen</i>; <i>Pen</i> is <i>head</i> in <i>british</i>.</p>

  <p><span lang="he">◊¢◊õ◊ü</span> <i>acan</i> in the <i>chaldee</i> signifies a <i>serpent</i>,
    and <i>hak</i> is no other than <i>snake</i>; the spirit in the
    pronunciation being naturally degenerated into a sibilation, as
    is often the case, and in this sibilating animal more easily. So
    <i>super</i> from <span lang="el">œÖœÄŒµœÅ</span>, <i>sylva</i> from <span lang="el">œÖŒªŒ∑</span>, <i>sudor</i>, <span lang="el">œÖŒ¥œâœÅ</span>.
    So our word <i>snap</i> comes from the <i>gallic</i> <i>happer</i>,
    a <i>snacot</i> fish from the <i>latin</i> <i>acus</i>, <i>aculeatus
    piscis</i>. And in <i>Yorkshire</i> they call snakes <i>hags</i>, and
    <i>hag-worms</i>. Vide <i>Fuller‚Äôs Misc.</i> IV. 15.</p>

  <p>The temple that stood here was intended for the head of the snake in
    the huge picture; and at a distance, when seen in perspective, it
    very aptly does it. It consisted of two concentric ovals, not much
    different from circles, their longest diameter being east and west. By
    the best intelligence I could obtain from the ruins of it, the outer
    circle was 80 and 90 cubits in diameter, the medium being 85, 146
    feet. It consisted of 40 stones, whereof 18 remained, left by farmer
    <i>Green</i>; but 3 standing. The inner circle was 26 and 30 cubits
    diameter, equal to the interval between circle and circle.</p>

  <p>The stones were 18 in number, somewhat bigger than of the outer
    circle, but all carried off by <i>Green</i> aforesaid. Every body here
    remembers both circles entire, and standing, except two or three fallen.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Aubury</i>, in his manuscript notes printed with <i>Camden</i>‚Äôs
    <i>Britannia</i>, mentions it, ‚Äúa double circle of stones, four or five
    feet high, tho‚Äô many are now fallen down. The diameter of the outer
    circle 40 yards, and of the inner 15. He speaks of the avenue coming up
    to it, as likewise of our before-describ‚Äôd avenue, from <i>Abury</i> to
    <i>West-Kennet</i>, set with large stones. One side, he says, is very
    nearly entire, the other side wants a great many.‚Äù He did not see that
    ‚Äôtis but one avenue from <i>Abury</i> to <i>Overton-hill</i>, having no
    apprehension of the double curve it makes. And he erred in saying there
    was a circular ditch on <i>Overton-hill</i>.</p>

  <p>The view here is extensive and beautiful. Down the river eastward we
    see <i>Marlborough</i>, and the whole course of the <i>Roman</i> road
    hence going along <i>Clatford-bottom</i>. We see a good way in the road
    to <i>Ambresbury</i>, and the gap of the <i>Wansdike</i>, where we
    pass thro‚Äô. Thence the <i>Wansdike</i> skims the edge of all the hill
    tops to <i>Runway-hill</i>. There we enter upon the view presented in
    <a href="#tab_XXI">plate XXI</a>. The <i>Roman</i> road runs upon the edge of the hill, on
    the right hand of that plate, between the barrows there. It descends
    the hill, and runs to the left hand of <i>Silbury</i>, and close by
    it; and then up <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span><i>Runway-hill</i>. Next we see <i>Oldbury</i>
    camp, over <i>West-Kennet</i> village. Then we may view the whole
    length of the avenue hence to <i>Abury</i>, and observe the two great
    curves it makes, to imitate the figure of a snake, as drawn in the
    ancient hieroglyphics. Coming from <i>Abury</i> town it curves to the
    right-hand or eastward, then winds as much to the west, till it ascends
    this <i>Overton-hill</i>, full east.</p>

  </div>

  <p>I observed the breadth of the avenue here is narrower than elsewhere,
    as being the neck of the snake. ‚ÄôTis 45 feet or 26 cubits, equal
    to the diameter of the inner circle here. And as it is narrower
    than elsewhere, they made the side-distance between stone and stone
    proportional, being two thirds of that in breadth. Mr. <i>Smith</i>,
    living here, informed me, that when he was a school-boy, the
    <i>Kennet</i> avenue was entire, from end to end. <i>Silbury-hill</i>
    answers the avenue directly, as it enters this temple, being full west
    hence. Here is a great number of barrows in sight from this place, two
    close by; and a little north-eastward that chain of barrows design‚Äôd in
    <a href="#tab_XXIX">plate XXIX.</a> the lower part, looking toward <i>Marlborough</i>. Human
    bones found in digging a little ditch by the temple, across some small
    barrows there, and where there were no barrows. Mr. <i>Aubury</i> says,
    sharp and form‚Äôd flints were found among them; arguments of great
    antiquity. They were of the lower class of <i>Britons</i>, that were
    not at the charge of a <i>tumulus</i>.</p>

  <p>Thus we have conducted one half, the forepart of the snake,
    in this mighty work, up to <i>Overton-hill</i>, where it reposed its bulky
    head, and not long ago made a most beautiful appearance. I happen‚Äôd
    to frequent this place in the very point of time, when there was a
    possibility just left, of preserving the memory of it. In order to
    do it, I have laid down the groundplot thereof in <a href="#tab_XX">plate XX.</a> just as
    I found it for three years together, before it was demolish‚Äôd. I
    found that a line drawn between <i>Overton-mill</i> and the entrance
    of <i>Kennet</i> avenue in <i>Abury</i> town,is the ground-line of
    this avenue, from which it makes two vast curves contrary ways, to
    imitate the winding of a snake, and the hieroglyphic figures we see
    on <i>Egyptian</i> and other monuments. From <i>Overton-mill</i> is a
    most glorious prospect, overlooking the whole extent of <i>Abury</i>
    temple, and the sacred field it stands in, and beyond that, into
    <i>Gloucestershire</i> and <i>Somersetshire</i>.</p>

    with its easy acclivity, fronting you directly, the northern end of

  <p>I observed many of these studied opportunities in this work, of
    introducing the ground and prospects, to render it more picture-like.</p>

  <p><i>Pausanias in B≈ìotic.</i> writes, that in the way from <i>Thebes</i>
    to <i>Glisas</i>, is a space fenc‚Äôd round with select stones, which
    the <i>Thebans</i> call the <i>snake‚Äôs head</i>. And they tell a silly
    story about it, of a snake putting his head out of a hole there, which
    <i>Tiresius</i> struck with his sword. Just by it, he says,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> is a hill
    call‚Äôd the <i>supreme</i>, and a temple to <i>Jupiter the supreme</i>,
    and the brook <i>Thermodon</i> runs under it.</p>

  <p>Can we doubt but this was an ancient temple, like what we are
    describing? It was built by <i>Cadmus</i>, or some of his people, of
    whom we shall talk more in <a href="#CHAP_XIV">chapter XIV.</a></p>

  <p>I conclude this account with a verse of the poet‚Äôs, which I believe was

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">AFTER</span> I had carefully laid down the plan of <i>Kennet</i> avenue,
    and not understanding the full purport of it; in the year 1722, I
    found out this other, extending itself above a mile from the town of
    <i>Abury</i>, by another direction. It goes toward the village of
    <i>Bekamton</i>, therefore I call it <i>Bekamton</i> avenue. ‚ÄôTis
    really the hinderpart of the hieroglyphic snake, which the Druids meant
    here to picture out, in this most portentous size.</p>

  <p>The former avenue goes out of <i>Abury</i> town at the south-east
    point; this full west, at the interval of 25 stones, or a quadrant of
    the great circle from <i>Kennet</i> avenue, and proceeds by the south
    side of the churchyard. Two stones lie by the parsonage-gate on the
    right hand. Those opposite to them on the left hand, in a pasture,
    were taken away 1702, as mark‚Äôd in the ground-plot of <i>Abury</i>.
    <i>Reuben Horsal</i> remembers three standing in the pasture. One now
    lies in the floor of the house in the churchyard. A little farther, one
    lies at the corner of the next house, on the right hand, by the lane
    turning off to the right, to the bridge. Another was broke in pieces
    to build that house with, <i>anno</i> 1714. Two more lie on the left
    hand, opposite. It then passes the beck, south of the bridge. Most
    of the stones hereabouts have been made use of about the bridge, and
    the causeway leading to it. A little spring arises at <i>Horslip</i>
    north-west, and so runs by here to <i>Silbury-hill</i>, where the real
    head of the <i>Kennet</i> is. But sometimes by a sudden descent of rain
    coming from <i>Monkton</i> and <i>Broad-Hinton</i>, this is very deep.
    The picture here humours the reality so far, as this may be call‚Äôd the
    vent of the snake.</p>

  <p>Now the avenue passes along a lane to the left hand of the <i>Caln</i>
    road, by a stone house call‚Äôd <i>Goldsmiths</i>-farm, and so thro‚Äô
    farmer <i>Griffin</i>‚Äôs yard, thro‚Äô one barn that stands across the
    avenue, then by another which stands on its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>direction. Two stones
    and their opposites still lie in the foundation; immediately after
    this, it enters the open plow‚Äôd fields; the <i>Caln</i> road running
    all this while north of it. If we look back and observe the bearings of
    <i>Abury</i> steeple, and other objects, a discerning eye finds, that
    it makes a great sweep or curve northwards. The avenue entring the open
    corn-fields, runs for some time by the hedge, on the right hand. When
    it has cross‚Äôd the way leading from <i>South-street</i>, we discern
    here and there the remains of it, in its road to <i>Longstone</i> cove.
    Farmer <i>Griffin</i> broke near 20 of the stones of this part of the
    avenue.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This <i>Longstone</i> cove, vulgarly call‚Äôd long stones, is properly a
    cove, as the old <i>Britons</i> call‚Äôd ‚Äôem, compos‚Äôd of three stones,
    like that most magnificent one we described, in the center of the
    northern temple at <i>Abury</i>; behind the inn. They are set upon
    the ark of a circle, regarding each other with an obtuse angle. This
    is set on the north side of the avenue; one of the stones of that
    side makes the back of the cove. This is the only particularity in
    which this avenue differs from the former. I take it to be chiefly a
    judicious affectation of variety, and serv‚Äôd as a <i>sacellum</i> or
    <i>proseucha</i> to the neighbourhood on ordinary days of devotion,
    <i>viz.</i> the sabbath-days. For if the Druids came hither in
    <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs time, and were disciples of his, as it appears to
    me; we cannot doubt of their observance of the sabbath. It stands on
    the midway of the length of the avenue, being the fiftieth stone.
    This opens to the south-east, as that of the northern temple to the
    north-east. ‚ÄôTis placed upon an eminence, the highest ground which the
    avenue passes over: these are call‚Äôd <i>Longstone</i>-fields from it.
    You have a good prospect hence, seeing <i>Abury</i> toward which the
    ground descends to the brook: <i>Overton-hill</i>, <i>Silbury</i>,
    <i>Bekamton</i>; and a fine country all around. Many stones by the
    way are just buried under the surface of the earth. Many lie in the
    balks and meres, and many fragments are remov‚Äôd, to make boundaries
    for the fields; but more whole ones have been burnt to build withal,
    within every body‚Äôs memory. One stone still remains standing, near
    <i>Longstone</i> cove.</p>

  <p><i>Longstone</i> cove, because standing in the open fields, between
    the <i>Caln</i> road and that to the <i>Bath</i>, is more talk‚Äôd of
    by the people of this country, than the larger, and more numerous in
    <i>Abury</i> town. Dr. <i>Musgrave</i> mentions it in his <i>Belgium
    Britannicum</i>, page 44. and in his map thereof.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Aubury</i> in his manuscript observations publish‚Äôd with Mr.
    <i>Camden</i>‚Äôs <i>Britannia</i>, speaks of them by the name of the
    <i>Devil‚Äôs coits</i>. Three huge stones then standing. It was really a
    grand and noble work. The stone left standing is 16 feet high, as many
    broad, 3¬Ω thick. The back stone is fallen flat on the ground, of
    like dimension.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The other was carried off by that destroyer <i>Richard Fowler</i>,
    together with many more, but seven years ago (when I was there). The
    people that saw it broken in pieces by fire, assured me there were
    perfect flints in its composition and bones. And I verily believe I
    saw a piece of this same stone in a garden-wall of the little alehouse
    below in <i>Bekamton</i>-road, which had evidently a bone in it. Whence
    probably we may conclude, that these stones were form‚Äôd by nature since
    <i>Noah</i>‚Äôs deluge, and these bones are of an antediluvian animal,
    which casually fell into the petrifying matter.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> They told me the stone
    contain‚Äôd 20 good loads, that the bones were in the middle of the
    stone, and as hard as the stone. That stone now standing, was the right
    hand or eastern jamb of the cove.</p>

  <p>A little way hence is a bit of heath-ground, but the plough will soon
    have devoured it. Here remains a great barrow, call‚Äôd <i>Longstone long
    barrow</i>; and from hence we see innumerable more barrows. The avenue
    continu‚Äôd its journey by the corn fields. Three stones lie still by the
    field-road coming from <i>South-street</i> to the <i>Caln</i>-road. Mr.
    <i>Alexander</i> told me he remember‚Äôd several stones standing by the
    parting of the roads under <i>Bekamton</i>, demolish‚Äôd by <i>Richard
    Fowler</i>. Then it descends by the road to <i>Cherill</i>, ‚Äôtill it
    comes to the <i>Bath</i>-road, close by the <i>Roman</i>-road, and
    there in the low valley it terminates, near a fine group of barrows,
    under <i>Cherill-hill</i>, in the way to <i>Oldbury-camp</i>; this
    is west of <i>Bekamton</i>-village. This point facing that group of
    barrows and looking up the hill is a most solemn and awful place; a
    descent all the way from <i>Longstone</i> cove, and directed to a
    descent, a great way further, down the <i>Bath</i>-road, where no less
    than five valleys meet. And in this very point only you can see the
    temple on <i>Overton-hill</i>, on the south side of <i>Silbury-hill</i>.</p>

  <p>Here I am sufficiently satisfied this avenue terminated, at the like
    distance from <i>Abury</i>-town, as <i>Overton-hill</i> was, in the
    former avenue; 100 stones on a side, 4000 cubits in length; ten
    <i>stadia</i> or the eastern mile. Several stones are left dispersedly
    on banks and meres of the lands. One great stone belonging to this end
    of the avenue, lies buried almost under ground, in the plow‚Äôd land
    between the barrow west of <i>Longstone</i> long barrow, and the last
    hedge in the town of <i>Bekamton</i>. <i>Richard Fowler</i> shew‚Äôd
    me the ground here, whence he took several stones and demolish‚Äôd
    them. I am equally satisfied there was no temple or circle of stones
    at this end of it. 1. Because it would be absurd in drawing. The
    head of the snake was aptly represented by that double circle on
    <i>Overton-hill</i>: but this place, the tail of the snake, admitted no
    such thing, and I doubt not but it grew narrower and narrower as before
    we observed, of the neck of the snake. 2. Here is not the least report
    of such a thing among the country people. It would most assuredly have
    been well known, because every stone was demolish‚Äôd within memory, when
    I was there. I cannot doubt but many have suffered since; and I have
    had very disagreeable accounts thereof sent to me. I apprehend this end
    of the avenue drew narrower in imitation of the tail of a snake, and
    that one stone stood in the middle of the end, by way of close. This I
    infer from the manner of the end of that avenue of the Druid temple at
    <i>Classerness</i>; which I take to be the tail of a snake. Of which
    hereafter.</p>

  <p>For a more mathematical determination of this end of the avenue, see
    Chap X. at the end.</p>

  <p>The avenue took another circular sweep of a contrary manner, as it
    descended from <i>Longstone</i> cove, bending southward.</p>

  <p><i>Bekamton</i>-village lies very low, at the bottom of a valley
    subject to inundations, and the ground is springy: they can‚Äôt make
    cellars there: whereas <i>Abury</i> is very dry, and their wells deep.</p>

  <p>There are many barrows on the south downs, between St.
    <i>Anne‚Äôs-hill</i> and <i>Bekamton</i>, which chiefly regard this
    avenue. Many as we go up to the <i>Roman</i> camp of <i>Oldbury</i>,
    and in <i>Yatesbury</i>-field. And pretty near the termination, in
    the valley of <i>Bekamton</i> under <i>Cherill-hill</i>, is a group
    or line of half a score of very different forms, which make a pretty
    appearance. So the valley along the present road from <i>Bekamton</i>
    to the <i>Devizes</i> and <i>Bath</i>, is full of barrows on both
    sides; all regarding this part of the sacred work, the tail of the
    snake.</p>

  <p>I am confident, the reader by this time has conceiv‚Äôd a just notion

    the noblest monument, which is probably on the face of the globe;
    which has stood so many ages, and was made to stand as many more. The
    grandeur of the work has render‚Äôd it altogether unnecessary to add any
    heightning, or any flourishes. I leave it as an out-line of the most
    masterly hand, a picture that requires no colouring.</p>

  <p>Concerning the forms of the religious performances here, I can say but
    little, more than that I see nothing, but what appears to be in the
    ancient patriarchal mode, before cover‚Äôd temples were introduc‚Äôd in
    the world; the √¶ra of which time, I am fully convinc‚Äôd, was that of
    the <i>Mosaick</i> tabernacle. We may well assert this to be ancienter
    than that time; as the largest, so probably one of the most ancient in
    the <i>Britannic</i> isles. The Druids were tempted to make this work
    here, by the appearance of the stones on the downs, on the other side
    of <i>Hakpen-hill</i>, call‚Äôd the gray weathers. Finding the ground
    all overspread with these enormous masses, they had no difficulty in
    resolving, and they made none in putting their resolution in execution;
    in conveying 650 of the choicest of them, to make this notable temple.
    Thus we cast up the number.</p>

  <p>The square of <i>Solomon</i>‚Äôs temple was 700 cubits; the diameter
    of <i>Abury</i> is 800. But <i>Abury</i>, in square content, is to
    <i>Solomon</i>‚Äôs temple as 50 to 49. If we take into the account the
    <i>vallum</i> of <i>Abury</i>, we find this would hold incomparably
    more people than the other, as spectators or assistants. An hun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>dred
    oxen in sacrifice was an hecatomb. Twenty two thousand were offered by
    <i>Solomon</i> at the dedication, beside other animals. Three times
    in the year the whole nation of <i>Israel</i> assembled there, to pay
    their devotions and sacrifices, the aboriginal covenant made between
    God and man, in order to obtain favour and pardon. For ought we know,
    there might be as many here, and on the same account. I believe their
    most common times of these extraordinary religious meetings were on the
    four quarters of the year, the equinoxes and solstices.</p>

  <p>We may well wonder how these people could bring together so many of
    these great stones, and set them up so exactly. The stones they had
    not far to fetch, only from the other side of the <i>Hakpen</i>, from
    the gray weathers. Their vicinity, their lying on the surface of the
    ground, the soil here being solid chalk, was the great inducement
    for the Druids, in these most early ages, to build this temple. The
    manner of their mechanics, which undoubtedly was very simple, must be
    equally surprizing. I apprehend, they brought the stones upon strong
    carriages, and drew them by men. For even in <i>C√¶sar</i>‚Äôs time,
    there was an infinite multitude of people. Their manner of raising
    the stones seems to have been with tall trees, us‚Äôd for leavers, and
    no doubt very artfully apply‚Äôd. The method of fixing these enormous
    blocks of stone was, to dig a hole in the solid chalk, and ram the
    foundation of it in, with lesser stones, flints, and coggles, very
    artfully. They are not let in above two feet and a half deep. And
    the country being all a solid bed of chalk, was another reason why
    here, as at <i>Stonehenge</i>, they chose it for this extraordinary
    building. The conducting and rightly managing an immense number of
    hands, the providing for their maintenance, was a matter of wisdom and
    great authority. The marvellous effect produced, might well establish
    the glory of the Druids of <i>Britain</i>, which echoed across the
    ocean, and very much favour‚Äôd the opinion mankind had conceiv‚Äôd of
    their practising magick. For magick is nothing else but the science
    that teaches us to perform wonderful and surprizing things, in the
    later acceptation of the word. And in very many ages after the Druid
    times, mankind had the same notion, and the vulgar have to this
    day, concerning these works. And most probably from them sprung the
    character, which <i>Pliny</i> gives of our <i>british</i> Druids
    practising magic, and being so great proficients therein, as to equal
    the <i>persian</i> and <i>chaldean magi</i>, ‚Äúso that one would even
    think,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúthe Druids had taught it them.‚Äù</p>

  <p>I judge it much more probable, the Druids learn‚Äôd it from them, at
    least they both derive it from the same original fountain. And whatever
    they might practise of real magic, the notion of mankind concerning
    them, receiv‚Äôd strength from the name <i>magi</i>, which they might
    bring with them from the east. <i>Magus</i> there originally signifies
    no more than a <i>priest</i>, or person who officiates in sacreds. The
    word comes from <i>maaghim meditabundi</i>, people of a contemplative,
    retir‚Äôd life; whom more commonly in the west, they call‚Äôd Druids. I am
    not dubious in thinking the times we are talking of, when this temple
    of <i>Abury</i> was built, are of the extremest antiquity, near that
    of <i>Abraham</i>. I was very often on the spot, furnish‚Äôd with what
    I thought a convincing argument, from considering the wear of the
    weather, what effect it had upon these stones of a very firm texture, a
    kind of gray marble. And thus my reasoning was founded.</p>

  <p>I had sufficient opportunity of comparing the effect of the weather
    upon the stones here, and upon those at <i>Stonehenge</i>. For some
    years together, I went from one to the other directly, staying a
    fortnight or more at each <span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>place to make my observations. Nothing
    is more manifest, than that the stones of <i>Stonehenge</i> have
    been chizel‚Äôd, some quite round, some on three sides, easily to be
    distinguish‚Äôd. The stones of <i>Abury</i> are absolutely untouch‚Äôd of
    tool. No doubt, at that time of day, the aboriginal patriarchal method
    from the foundation of the world was observ‚Äôd, not to admit a tool upon
    them. Even when <i>Solomon</i>‚Äôs temple was built, tho‚Äô the stones were
    all carv‚Äôd with great art, yet that was done before they were brought
    to the building; for no ax or hammer was heard thereon. The like,
    probably, may be said of <i>Stonehenge</i>.</p>

  <p>It seems likely, that when <i>Stonehenge</i> was built, the Druids
    had some notice from <i>ph≈ìnician</i> traders, of the nature of
    <i>Solomon</i>‚Äôs temple; therefore they made their impost work, as
    some kind of advance, toward a cover‚Äôd temple, and likewise chizel‚Äôd
    their stones in compliance thereto. By using the best of my judgment,
    in comparing the effect of the weather upon <i>Stonehenge</i> and
    <i>Abury</i>, I could easily induce myself to think that <i>Abury</i>
    was as old again. For in some places there were cavities a yard long,
    corroded by time, and on those sides that originally lay on the ground,
    which, if they had not been expos‚Äôd to the weather, by being set
    upright, would have been smooth. Several other persons of good judgment
    have been of the same sentiment.</p>

    <i>Of the barrows or sepulchral tumuli about</i> Abury, <i>very

    or long barrows.</i> Silbury <i>much the largest barrow about</i>
    Abury, <i>and perhaps in the world. The temple built, seemingly,
    on account of this barrow. The sacred character as a prophylactic
    to the ashes of the dead. The Druids taught the resurrection
    of the body as well as soul. The great king dug up, who was
    interred at top. His most ancient bridle found with the corps, in
    possession of the author. The</i> british <i>chariots an oriental
    usage. A conjecture of the name of this king</i>, Cunedha,
    <i>who lived at</i> Marlborough. <i>Of the fountain of the</i>
    Kennet <i>hard by, taking its name from him. The dimension
    of</i> Silbury-hill, <i>its solid content. A demonstration
    of the</i> Roman <i>road made since</i> Silbury-hill. <i>A
    conjecture concerning the time of year when this prince died.
    The anniversaries of the ancients at the tombs of the dead. What
    has been found in other barrows here. Beads of amber, and other
    matter, as glass, earth, &amp;c. A flat gold ring, spear-heads, a bit
    of gold. Another demonstration of the</i> Roman <i>road being
    later than these works. An entire urn which the author dug up.
    A double circle of stones at</i> Winterburn-basset. <i>Pyriform
    barrows. Of long barrows or archdruids‚Äô. Very large ones here,
    above 300 foot long. Some set round with stones. Some with great
    stoneworks at the end.</i>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">SO</span> many ages as <i>Abury</i> was the great cathedral, the chief
    metropolitical or patriarchal temple of the island, no wonder there
    are an infinite number of these barrows about it. Great princes, and
    men within a considerable tract of country round here, would naturally
    choose to leave their mortal remains in this sacred ground, more
    peculiarly under the divine regard. Every hill-top within view of the
    place is sure to be crowned with them. As at <i>Stonehenge</i>, so
    here, there are great varieties of them, which no doubt, originally,
    had their distinctions of the quality and profession of the person
    interr‚Äôd. In the additions to Mr. <i>Camden</i>‚Äôs <i>Wiltshire</i>,
    several sorts of them are mention‚Äôd.</p>

  <p>1. Small circular trenches, with very little elevation in the middle.
    These are what I call (for distinction-sake) Druid barrows. An eminent
    one I have given <a href="#tab_XXII">plate XXII</a>, on the <i>Hakpen</i> hill, overlooking
    <i>Kennet</i> avenue.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

  <p>2. Ordinary barrows, meaning plain round ones, common all over
    <i>England</i>. Some may be <i>roman</i>, or <i>saxon</i>, or
    <i>danish</i>, as well as <i>british</i>.</p>

  <p>3. Barrows with ditches round them. These are commonly such as I esteem
    royal, of the newest fashion among the old <i>Britons</i>; generally of
    an elegantly turn‚Äôd bell-form. These two last sort I call king-barrows.</p>

  <p>4. Large oblong barrows, some with trenches round them, others without.
    These I call, for method sake, archdruids‚Äô barrows. Several of ‚Äôem
    near <i>Abury</i> and <i>Stonehenge</i>. And sometimes we find ‚Äôem
    in other places about the kingdom. A druid celt was found in that
    north of <i>Stonehenge</i>, which induc‚Äôd me to give them the title.
    I shall speak a little concerning them in the method mention‚Äôd, as
    they are observable about <i>Abury</i>, but we ought to begin with
    <i>Silbury</i>, which, says our right reverend and learned author, is
    the largest barrow in the county, and perhaps in all <i>England</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Silbury</i> indeed is a most astonishing collection of earth,
    artificially rais‚Äôd, worthy of <i>Abury</i>, worthy of the king who was
    the royal founder of <i>Abury</i>, as we may very plausibly affirm. By
    considering the picture of <i>Abury</i> temple, we may discern, that as
    this immense body of earth was rais‚Äôd for the sake of the interment of
    this great prince, whoever he was: so the temple of <i>Abury</i> was
    made for the sake of this <i>tumulus</i>; and then I have no scruple
    to affirm, ‚Äôtis the most magnificent <i>mausoleum</i> in the world,
    without excepting the <i>Egyptian</i> pyramids.</p>

  <p><a href="#tab_XXVI"><i>Silbury</i></a> stands exactly south of <i>Abury</i>,
    and exactly between the two extremities of the two avenues, the head and tail of
    the snake. The work of <i>Abury</i>, which is the circle, and the two
    avenues which represent the snake transmitted thro‚Äô it, are the great
    <i>hierogrammaton</i>, or sacred prophylactic character of the divine
    mind, which is to protect the <i>depositum</i> of the prince here
    interr‚Äôd. The <i>Egyptians</i>, for the very same reason, frequently
    pictur‚Äôd the same hieroglyphic upon the breast of their mummies, as
    particularly on that in my lord <i>Sandwich</i>‚Äôs collection; and very
    frequently on the top and summit of <i>Egyptian</i> obeliscs, this
    picture of the serpent and circle is seen; and upon an infinity of
    their monuments. In the very same manner this huge snake and circle,
    made of stones, hangs, as it were, brooding over <i>Silbury-hill</i>,
    in order to bring again to a new life the person there buried. For our
    Druids taught the expectation of a future life, both soul and body,
    with greatest care, and made it no less than a certainty.</p>

  <p>‚ÄôTill in the month of March, 1723, Mr. <i>Halford</i> order‚Äôd some
    trees to be planted on this hill, in the middle of the noble plain or
    <i>area</i> at the top, which is 60 cubits diameter. The workmen dug
    up the body of the great king there buried in the center, very little
    below the surface. The bones extremely rotten, so that they crumbled
    them in pieces with their fingers. The soil was altogether chalk, dug
    from the side of the hill below, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> which the whole barrow is made.
    Six weeks after, I came luckily to rescue a great curiosity which they
    took up there; an iron chain, as they called it, which I bought of
    <i>John Fowler</i>, one of the workmen: it was the bridle buried along
    with this monarch, being only a solid body of rust. I immerg‚Äôd it in
    limner‚Äôs drying oil, and dried it carefully, keeping it ever since very
    dry. It is now as fair and entire as when the workmen took it up. I
    have given a sketch of it in <a href="#tab_XXXVI">plate XXXVI</a>.
    There were deers‚Äô horns, an iron knife with a bone handle too, all excessively rotten, taken up
    along with it.</p>

  <p><i>Pausanias</i>, in <i>Eliacis</i>, writes, how in his time, a
    <i>roman</i> senator conquer‚Äôd at the <i>olympic</i> games. He had a
    mind to leave a monument of his victory, being a brazen statue with
    an inscription. Digging for the foundation, just by the pillar of
    <i>Oenomaus</i>, they took up fragments of a shield, a bridle and
    <i>armilla</i>, which he saw.</p>

  <p>Our bridle belong‚Äôd to the harness of a <i>british</i> chariot, and
    brings into our thoughts the horses and chariots of <i>Egypt</i>,
    mention‚Äôd in earliest days. The <i>Tyrian Hercules</i>, who, I
    suppose, might bring the first oriental colony hither, was a
    king in <i>Egypt</i>. In scripture, when <i>Joseph</i> was prime
    minister there, we find chariots frequently mention‚Äôd, both for
    civil and military use. In <i>Joshua</i>‚Äôs time, xvii. 16, 18. the
    <i>Canaanites</i>, <i>Rephaim</i> or giants, (<i>Titans</i>) and
    <i>Perizzites</i> had them. So the <i>Philistines</i>. Our ancestors
    the <i>Britons</i> coming both from <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Canaan</i>,
    brought hither the use of chariots; and they remain‚Äôd, in a manner,
    singular and proper to our island, to the time that the <i>romans</i>
    peopled it. And it was fashionable for the <i>romans</i> at
    <i>Rome</i>, in the height of their luxury, to have <i>british</i>
    chariots, as we now <i>berlins</i>, <i>landaus</i>, and the like.</p>

  <p><i>Philostratus</i>, <i>vit. sophist.</i> xxv. <i>Polemon</i>, remarks
    the enameling and ornament of <i>phrygian</i> and <i>celtic</i>
    bridles, as being very curiously wrought. Ours is perfectly plain and
    rude; an argument of its great antiquity.</p>

  <p><a href="#tab_XXVII"><i>Silbury</i></a> is the name of the hill given by our <i>saxon</i>
    ancestors, meaning the <i>great</i> or <i>marvellous hill</i>. So
    <i>Silchester</i>, the <i>Vindoma</i> of the <i>Romans</i>, means the
    <i>great Chester</i>. It cannot help us to the name of the monarch
    there buried. When I consider this hill standing at the fountain of
    the <i>Kennet Cunetio</i>, still call‚Äôd <i>Cunnet</i> by the country
    people, and that among the most ancient <i>Britons</i> the name of
    <i>Cunedha</i> is very famous, that they talk much of a great king
    of this name, it would tempt one to conjecture, this is the very
    man. This conjecture receives some strength from what my old friend
    Mr. <i>Baxter</i> writes about <i>Cunetio</i> or <i>Marlborough</i>,
    which the river first visits. He thinks it had its name from a
    famous king, <i>Cunedha</i>, who lived at <i>Marlborough</i>,
    called <i>Kynyd Kyn√ºidion</i>, which we may <i>english</i>,
    <i>Cunedha</i> of <i>Marlborough</i>, which name is mention‚Äôd in
    the ancient <i>british</i> genealogies before the grandfather of
    king <i>Arthur</i>; tho‚Äô we scarce imagine their genealogies can
    truly reach the founder we are thinking of. But <i>Cyngetorix</i>,
    a king in <i>Britain</i>, who fought <i>Julius C√¶sar</i>, and
    <i>Cunobelin</i>, king of the island in <i>Augustus</i>‚Äôs time, may
    be descendants of this man, at least their names have some relation.
    And in <i>C√¶sar</i>‚Äôs <i>Comment.</i> B. G. VII. <i>Conetodunus</i> a
    <i>gaulish</i> prince, is the same name.</p>

  <p>We may remember too, that <i>Merlin</i> the magician, who is said
    to have made <i>Stonehenge</i> by his magic, is affirm‚Äôd to have
    been buried at <i>Marlborough</i>. Mr. <i>Camden</i> recites it from
    <i>Alexander Necham</i>. Doubtless <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span><i>Stonehenge</i>, much more
    <i>Abury</i>, are incomparably older than <i>Merlin‚Äôs</i> time. But
    the oldest reports we can expect to have of these affairs, must be
    from the <i>Britons</i>, the oldest inhabitants left. And ‚Äôtis natural
    for them to affix old traditions vastly beyond their knowledge, to
    the last famous persons they have any account of; so that we may well
    judge some truths are generally latent in these old reports. It is
    likely our king <i>Kunedha</i> lived at <i>Marlborough</i>, was buried
    in <i>Silbury</i>, was the founder of <i>Abury</i>. And the archdruid,
    who with him was the projector and executor of the stupendous work of
    <i>Abury</i>, was buried at <i>Marlborough</i>. For <i>Marlborough</i>
    is in sight of that part of the temple which is the <i>Hakpen</i>, or
    snake‚Äôs head, on <i>Overton-hill</i>.</p>

      <i>Prospect of Kennet Avenue from the Druids tumulus on Hakpen hill.
        May 15<sup>th</sup>. 1724.</i>
    </div>

  <p><i>Strabo</i> writes in XII, that there is a <i>tumulus</i> of
    king <i>Marsyas</i>, where he was buried, at the head of the river
    <i>Marsyas</i>. This seems to be an exact parallel case with ours,
    and that the river preserves the name of the king to this day, from
    whom it had its name. <i>Pausanias B≈ìot.</i> writes, the tomb of
    <i>Asphodicus</i> is at the spring-head of the river <i>Oedipodias</i>.
    And <i>Tiresias</i>‚Äôs sepulchre is by the fountain <i>Telphussa</i>.
    And the like of very many more.</p>

  <p>The person that projected the forming this vast body of earth,
    <i>Silbury-hill</i>, had a head as well as hands, and well chose his
    ground, well contriv‚Äôd how to execute his purpose. He pitch‚Äôd upon the
    foot of the chalk hill, by the fountain of the <i>Kennet</i>, in the
    very meridian line of <i>Abury</i>. The bottom of the hill is natural
    earth, and beyond the verge of its circumference at bottom, they dug
    the earth of the hill away to the level of the adjacent meadow, in
    order to furnish materials for the artificial part of the hill, leaving
    as it were an isthmus, or neck of original land. Further, to render
    this artificial part more detach‚Äôd from the natural, they dug a deep
    trench on the land-side, in the middle of the isthmus, but left two
    bridges, as it were, or passages up to the hill. By this means the
    ascent for the multitude employ‚Äôd, was render‚Äôd more easy, for the
    natural hill was as a half-pause or resting-place for them.</p>

  <p>The diameter of <i>Silbury-hill</i>
    at top is 105 feet, the same as <i>Stonehenge</i>. At bottom ‚Äôtis somewhat more than 500 feet,
    in reality 300 cubits, as at top 60 cubits. 100 cubits its exact
    perpendicular altitude. They that have seen the circumference of
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, will admire that such an <i>area</i> should be
    carried up 170 feet perpendicular, with a sufficient base to support
    it: and they that consider the geometry of this barrow, as I have drawn
    it in <a href="#tab_XXVIII">plate XXVIII</a>, will be equally pleased with the natural and easy
    proportion of it. But without actually seeing it, we can scarce have
    a full idea of it. The solid contents of it amount to 13558809 cubic
    feet. Some people have thought it would cost 20000<i>l.</i> to make
    such a hill.</p>

  <p>Some old people remember king <i>Charles</i> II, the duke of
    <i>York</i>, and duke of <i>Monmouth</i> riding up it. The
    <i>Roman</i> way, <i>via Badonica</i>, coming from <i>Overton-hill</i>
    to <i>Runway-hill</i>, should have pass‚Äôd directly thro‚Äô
    <i>Silbury-hill</i>; wherefore they curv‚Äôd a little southward to avoid
    it, and it runs close by the isthmus of the hill, then thro‚Äô the fields
    of <i>Bekamton</i>. This shews <i>Silbury-hill</i> was ancienter than
    the <i>Roman</i> road. They have lately fenc‚Äôd out the <i>Roman</i>
    road (which they call the <i>french way</i>) in the plough‚Äôd fields of
    <i>Bekamton</i>; but you see the continuation of it when it reaches the
    heath ground, as in <a href="#tab_IX">plate IX</a>.</p>

  <p>It seems no difficult matter to point out the time of the year when
    this great prince died, who is here interr‚Äôd, <i>viz.</i> about
    the beginning of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> present <i>April</i>. I gather it from this
    circumstance. The country people have an anniversary meeting on
    the top of <i>Silbury-hill</i> on every <i>palm-sunday</i>, when
    they make merry with cakes, figs, sugar, and water fetch‚Äôd from the
    <i>swallow-head</i>, or spring of the <i>Kennet</i>. This spring was
    much more remarkable than at present, gushing out of the earth in a
    continued stream. They say it was spoil‚Äôd by digging for a fox who
    earth‚Äôd above, in some cranny thereabouts; this disturb‚Äôd the sacred
    nymphs, in a poetical way of speaking.</p>

  <p>We observed before, concerning the temple of <i>Rowldrich</i>, there
    was a like anniversary meeting at that place, which doubtless has been
    continued thro‚Äô all ages, and all succession of inhabitants, from the
    death of the arch-druid there buried. If we read the fifth <i>√Üneid</i>
    of <i>Virgil</i>, we shall there find the major part of it to be a
    description of the very matters we are writing of. The great poet who
    affectedly describes all ancient customs, speaks of his hero making a
    <i>tumulus</i> for his father <i>Anchises</i>, and a temple and sacred
    grove; providing priests and officers necessary for that purpose.
    Celebrating the anniversary remembrance of his deceased parent, with
    great magnificence, with sacrifices, feasting, games, sports and
    exercises, and distributing rewards to the victors. So <i>Virgil</i> in
    <i>Georg.</i> 3.</p>

  <p class="noindent">So <i>Herodotus</i> describing the manner of sepulture among the
    <i>Thracians</i> and <i>Macedonians</i>. The whole matter is so
    notorious, that I leave the reader to make the particular application
    and parallel. Here at <i>Silbury</i>, the country being all a fine and
    exquisite down, I cannot point out the place where the games were kept:
    perhaps on the meadow between <i>Abury</i> and the hill.</p>

  <p>I took notice that <i>apium</i> grows plentifully about the spring-head
    of the <i>Kennet</i>. <i>Pliny</i> writes <i>defunctorum epulis dicatum
    apium</i>. To this day the country people have a particular regard for
    the herbs growing there, and a high opinion of their virtue.</p>

  <p>The king-barrows which are round, both here and elsewhere vary in their
    turn and shape, as well as magnitude, as we see in a group together;
    whereof still very many are left, many destroy‚Äôd by the plough. Some
    of the royal barrows are extremely old, being broad and flat, as if
    sunk into the ground with age. There is one near <i>Longstone</i> cove
    set round with stones. I have depicted two groups of them, one by the
    serpent‚Äôs head, on <a href="#tab_XXIX"><i>Overton-hill</i></a>; another by the serpent‚Äôs tail,
    in the way between <i>Bekamton</i> and <i>Oldbury</i> camp: some flat,
    some campani-form, some ditch‚Äôd about, some not. One near the temple
    on <i>Overton-hill</i> was quite levell‚Äôd for ploughing <i>anno</i>
    1720; a man‚Äôs bones were found within a bed of great stones, forming a
    kind of arch. Several beads of amber long and round, as big as one‚Äôs
    thumb end, were taken from it, and several enamel‚Äôd <i>British</i>
    beads of glass: I got some of them, white in colour, some were green.
    They commonly reported the bones to be larger than common. So <i>Virgil
    Georg.</i> 1.</p>

    and rib‚Äôd, the other less, of a dark blue, taken up in one of the two
    barrows on <i>Hakpen-hill</i>, east of <i>Kennet</i> avenue. These
    two barrows are ditch‚Äôd about, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>and near one another. The single
    barrow next it toward the snake‚Äôs head temple, is large and beautifully
    turn‚Äôd, with a ditch about it, at a distance, which throws it into a
    campanule form.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Bray</i> of <i>Monkton</i> open‚Äôd a barrow, among many others,
    at <i>Yatesbury</i>. There was a great stone laid at top, just under
    the surface. When taken up, they found a body laid in a stone coffin,
    form‚Äôd by several stones. He says, in another they found a body, with
    a flat gold ring, which was sold for 30<i>s.</i> and a piece of brass,
    about the bulk of a pint mug, with spear-heads of iron.</p>

  <p>A man of <i>Ambresbury</i>, who had liv‚Äôd here, told me of a brass
    spear-head dug up in a barrow between <i>Monkton</i> and <i>Abury</i>,
    by a body: and that under some stones in a barrow, south of
    <i>Silbury</i>, they found a bit of gold, (I suppose the covering of a
    button, or the like, such as that I dug up at <i>Stonehenge</i>,) and
    many sharp bits of iron.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Aubury</i> speaks of a barrow opened in <i>Kennet</i> parish,
    <i>anno</i> 1643, two stones 11 feet long, laid side by side, and a
    corps between, with a sword and knife. Another like stone laid over all.</p>

  <p>There is a very delicate hill north of <i>Abury</i>, of a round form,
    with an easy ascent quite round; ‚Äôtis call‚Äôd <a href="#tab_XVIII"><i>Windmill-hill</i></a>.
    The turf as soft as velvet. ‚ÄôTis encompass‚Äôd with a circular trench,
    exceeding old. Fifteen barrows of a most ancient shape thereon. Many
    barrows are on the top, of several shapes. I open‚Äôd a small one, very
    old, flat, and round, and found an entire urn turn‚Äôd up-side down, into
    a hole cut in the solid chalk. The bones very rotten. I have given a
    drawing of the urn, <a href="#tab_XXXVI">plate XXXVI</a>. It was red without, black within,
    14 inches high, 9 in diameter at the aperture, wrought a little both
    within and without, and at the bottom, which stood uppermost.</p>

  <p>South of <i>Abury</i> town is a hill, between it and <i>Silbury</i>,
    call‚Äôd <i>Windmill-hill</i>; it lies between our two avenues, and
    intercepts the view from one to the other. This too is crown‚Äôd with
    barrows of different sorts and sizes. The <i>Via Badonica</i> runs
    on the southern skirt of it, going from <i>Overton-hill</i> to
    <i>Silbury</i>. I took notice there of a barrow of that kind I call
    <i>Druids</i>. This happening too near the track of the <i>Roman</i>
    road, it goes over part of it. Part is fill‚Äôd up, and the lump in
    the middle, under which the urn lay, they have dug away: A further
    demonstration, that it is of a date posterior to our <i>celtic</i>
    works here. This hill too is call‚Äôd <i>Weedon-hill</i>, perhaps from
    the <i>Roman</i> way.</p>

  <p>At <i>Winterburn-basset</i>, a little north of <i>Abury</i>, in a field
    north-west of the church, upon elevated ground, is a double circle
    of stones concentric, 60 cubits diameter. The two circles are near
    one another, so that one may walk between. Many of the stones have of
    late been carry‚Äôd away. West of it is a single, broad, flat, and high
    stone, standing by itself. And about as far northward from the circle,
    in a plough‚Äôd field, is a barrow set round with, or rather compos‚Äôd of
    large stones. I take this double circle to have been a family-chapel,
    as we may call it, to an archdruid dwelling near thereabouts, whilst
    <i>Abury</i> was his cathedral.</p>

  <p>There are likewise about <i>Abury</i> some pyriform barrows,
    longish, but broad at one end: some compos‚Äôd of earth, thrown into
    a <i>tumulus</i>. Of this sort a very long one in the valley from
    <i>Bekamton</i> to <i>Runway-hill</i>. Another among the furze bushes
    south of <i>Silbury</i>, set with stones, which farmer <i>Green</i>
    carry‚Äôd away. Others made of stones set upright in that form. Of the
    latter, a very large one in <i>Monkton-fields</i>, about 20 stones
    left on one side.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> ‚ÄôTis directly north of <i>Abury</i> town. Another
    such south of <i>Silbury-hill</i>. Another pyriform, made only of
    earth, under <i>Runway-hill</i>. Another on the hill south-west from
    <i>Bekamton</i>, cut through with some later division dike.</p>

  <p>The long barrows are what I call archdruids‚Äô. There are but few about
    <i>Abury</i> left, and but two at <i>Stonehenge</i>. The paucity seems
    to confirm the notion. One very large at <i>East-Kennet</i>, points
    to <i>Abury</i>, but with its lesser end: no less than 200 cubits in
    length, which is 350 feet, a huge body of earth. Another not far off
    points to the snake‚Äôs head temple, being at a right angle with the
    former.</p>

  <p>By <i>Horslip-gap</i> is another considerable long barrow of a large
    bulk, length and height: it regards the snake‚Äôs head temple, tho‚Äô here
    not in sight.</p>

  <p>By <i>Bekamton</i> cove another, a vast body of earth, as thick as the
    <i>vallum</i> of <i>Abury</i>, and points to the cove hard by; which
    shews that cove to be as a chapel. Another large round barrow near it.</p>

  <p>In <i>Monkton</i>, west of the town, is a large and flat long
    barrow, set round with stones, which I have depicted in <a href="#tab_XXX">plate XXX</a>,
    ‚Äôtis just 120 cubits long, 30 cubits broad in the broadest end. It
    stands due east and west, the broadest end eastward. Its breadth the
    fourth part of its length: a most magnificent sepulchre, and call‚Äôd
    <i>Milbarrow</i>.</p>

  <p>But even this is much exceeded in south long barrow, near
    <i>Silbury-hill</i>, south of it, and upon the bank of the
    <i>Kennet</i>. It stands east and west, pointing to the dragon‚Äôs head
    on <i>Overton-hill</i>. A very operose <i>congeries</i> of huge stones
    upon the east end, and upon part of its back or ridge; pil‚Äôd one upon
    another, with no little labour: doubtless in order to form a sufficient
    chamber, for the remains of the person there buried; not easily to
    be disturbed. The whole <i>tumulus</i> is an excessively large mound
    of earth 180 cubits long, ridg‚Äôd up like a house. And we must needs
    conclude, the people that made these durable <i>mausolea</i>, had a
    very strong hope of the resurrection of their bodies, as well as souls
    who thus provided against their being disturbed.</p>

  <p>Upon the heath south of <i>Silbury-hill</i>, was a very large oblong
    work, like a long barrow, made only of stones pitch‚Äôd in the ground, no
    <i>tumulus</i>. Mr. <i>Smith</i> beforemention‚Äôd told me, his cousin
    took the stones away (then) 14 years ago, to make mere stones withal.
    I take it to have been an archdruid‚Äôs, tho‚Äô humble, yet magnificent;
    being 350 feet or 200 cubits long.</p>

  <p><i>Pausanias in Eliac.</i> II. writes, upon the bank of the
    river <i>Cladeus</i> is the barrow of <i>√Ünomaus</i>; of earth,
    incompass‚Äôd with stones. Again in <i>Arcadic.</i> he says, at
    <i>Pergamus</i> is the monument of <i>Auge</i>, being a barrow of
    earth, incompass‚Äôd with a circle of stones. In the same <i>Arcadic.</i>
    Book VIII. he says, he studiously contemplated the <i>tumulus</i> of
    <i>√Üpitus</i>, because <i>Homer</i> makes mention of it, admiring
    it, for he had seen no finer. ‚ÄôTwas made of earth not very large,
    incompass‚Äôd with a circle of stones. Thus naturally does a genius
    admire works of antiquity! he seems thereby to antedate his own being,
    and to have lived in those times long before. He writes again <i>in
      B≈ìot.</i> at the barrow of <i>Amphion</i> are many rude stones, which
    they report, were the stones he drew together with his harp. Likewise
    there are three rude stones near the tomb of <i>Melanippus</i>; and the
    antiquarians say, <i>Tydeus</i> was buried there.</p>

  <p>To go much higher in time, and equal to those we have been describing:
    <i>Genes.</i> xxxv. 20. <i>Jacob set a pillar upon Rachel‚Äôs grave.</i></p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">THERE</span> is still another of these long archdruids‚Äô <i>tumuli</i> at
    <i>Abury</i>, which leads me to describe a kind of ancient monuments
    which I meet with here, and near <i>Stonehenge</i> and elsewhere; which
    I take to be houses of the Druids, or their courts of judicature,
    or both. The principal of them here, is a remarkable thing, upon
    the <i>Hakpen-hill</i> east of <i>Abury</i>, near a mile, between
    it and <i>Rockley</i>. That part of the downs thereabouts is called
    <i>Temple-downs</i>, and the thing is called <i>old Chapel</i>. Lord
    <i>Winchelsea</i>, Lord and Lady <i>Hertford</i> and myself were
    curious in observing it, <i>July 6, 1723</i>. ‚ÄôTis a large square,
    intrench‚Äôd, 110 druid cubits by 130, like a little <i>Roman</i> camp,
    with one entrance on the south-west side, towards <i>Abury</i>: for
    it is posited with accuracy, (as all these works are) from north-east
    to south-west. The situation of the place is high, and has a descent,
    quite round three of its sides; the verge of the descent inclosing it
    like a horseshoe. The entrance is on the side next <i>Abury</i>, on
    the isthmus of the peninsula (as it were,) on the shortest side of the
    square, the south-west. It is made of a vallum and ditch; beyond that,
    a row of flat stones set quite round and pretty close to one another,
    like a wall. Beyond that, another lesser ditch. There are stones too
    set on each side the entrance. On the north-west side is a large long
    barrow 50 cubits in length, with two great stone works upon it. One
    on the end next the great inclos‚Äôd place, we have been describing:
    another stonework towards the other end; which seems to have been a
    semicircular cove, or <i>demi-ellipsis</i> consisting of five great
    stones; a <i>Stonehenge</i> cell in miniature, but now in ruins. This
    probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
    gave the name of <i>old Chapel</i> to the place; the barrow
    likewise has been set quite round with great stones.</p>

  <p>In the second stone-work, one stone lies flat on the ground, along the
    middle line of the barrow. On each side a flat stone stands upright,
    and two flat stones stand upright at right angles, as wings to ‚Äôem.
    Upon them I suppose other stones were pil‚Äôd as a <i>kist-vaen</i>. Here
    probably lies the body of the interr‚Äôd. The stones are generally very
    large, about ten feet long.</p>

  <p>The whole I take to have been the palace and interment of an
    arch-druid, and his tribunal or seat of justice. ‚ÄôTis posited exactly
    enough south-east and north-west. The learned Mr. <i>Rowland</i>, who
    wrote the history of the <i>Isle of Mona</i>, describes just such works
    as this in that place, and calls them houses of the Druids.</p>

  <p>This place stands near a great cavity call‚Äôd <i>Balmore-pond</i>, which
    seems to have some regard to this work. ‚ÄôTis a pyriform concavity,
    set with stones on the inside. It answers exactly to <i>old chapel
      entrance</i>; and the people have a report that there is a vault under
    it. One would be tempted to think it was a prison, and the pond was the
    place of executions, being form‚Äôd theatrically. Otherwise it might be a
    place of sports and spectacles. ‚ÄôTis 150 cubits broad, 180 long, form‚Äôd
    like an <i>Amazonian</i> shield.</p>

  <p>In a valley between here and <i>Rockley</i>, are nine round barrows
    of different bulk. And upon all the highest ground thereabouts are an
    infinite quantity of immense stones, or sarsens, or gray weathers, some
    of as large dimensions as any at <i>Abury</i>, and lying as thick as
    leaves in <i>autumn</i>. Some upon the very surface of the ground, some
    half sunk in; and many deep holes whence stones have been taken, are
    visible.</p>

  <p>If we descend the <i>Hakpen-hill</i>, westward from hence towards
    <i>Winterburn-basset</i>, upon the declivity of the <i>Hakpen</i>, is
    another Druid‚Äôs house, called too <i>Old Chapel</i>. ‚ÄôTis a square,
    double ditch‚Äôd, but small ditches, in the middle a broad oblong square
    bank. Before it a sort of court, nearly as big as the other. Near it,
    they say, they have found much old iron and pewter. It seems to have
    been set round with stones.</p>

  <p>There is another of these places in a delightful circular hollow, under
    the <a href="#tab_XIX"><i>Hakpen-hill</i></a>, on the west side, hanging over <i>Kennet</i>
    avenue, just 180 cubits square. It lies on a northern declivity, for
    coolness as one may judge. The entrance is in the middle of the lowest
    side. But toward the upper side is another lesser oblong square, what
    we should call a <i>pr√¶torium</i> in a <i>Roman</i> camp. And to this
    there was a distinct entrance on the south. ‚ÄôTis plac‚Äôd exactly north
    and south.</p>

  <p>In <i>Bekamton</i> town, near the termination of <i>Bekamton</i>
    avenue, or the snake‚Äôs tail, is such another place, call‚Äôd <i>Old
      Chapel</i> or <i>Chapel field</i>. ‚ÄôTis full of great stones, many
    buried under-ground. <i>Richard Fowler</i>, that great depopulator,
    told me, he demolished one stone standing near the hedge of the
    pasture. Near it a great stone lies upon the mouth of an old well, as
    they say, but never remember that it was open, only speak by tradition.
    This field belongs still to the church.</p>

  <p>There is another very pretty place of this sort (for ought I know)
    between the <i>Wansdike</i> and <i>Via Badonica</i>, running up
    <a href="#tab_XI"><i>Runway-hill</i></a>. ‚ÄôTis a charming pleasant concavity. An oblong
    square, with another lesser, as a <i>pr√¶torium</i> within. In the
    <i>vallum</i> are many gaps at equal intervals. You will see a large
    part of it in plate XI. called the model of a camp. ‚ÄôTis abusing our
    time to be tedious, either in descriptions or enquiries, about these
    matters, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>of which ‚Äôtis scarce possible to arrive at any certainty
    at this time of day. The pleasure arising from them, is in being upon
    the spot, and treading the agreeable downy turf, crowded with these
    antiquities; where health to the body and amusement to the mind are
    mingled so effectually together.</p>

    Underneath is the <i>british</i> urn which I dug up in a barrow on
    <i>Windmill-hill</i> north of <i>Abury</i>. This plate is consecrated
    to the memories of Sir <i>Robert Halford</i>, knight, and <i>Charles
    Tucker</i>, Esq; who were very solicitous in preserving these noble
    antiquities.</p>

  <p>I have given the reader as plain and as concise a description of these
    works about <i>Abury</i>, as I possibly could. We cannot but make
    this general reflexion upon the whole: 1. That this temple, with the
    things belonging to it, when in perfection, must have been the work
    of a very great and learned people. The kind, manner, and idea of it,
    shews its extreme antiquity. When we view the ruins of <i>Rome</i>, of
    <i>Greece</i>, <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Syria</i>, <i>Persia</i>, or the like,
    we readily enough enter into a notion of the wisdom and flourishing
    estate of the people that performed them. The like we must do of these
    <i>british</i> Druids. These very works justify the high reports made
    concerning them in classic authors. And if we pretend to oppose them
    by other reports out of like authors, concerning the rudeness and
    barbarity of the old <i>Britons</i>; the answer is obvious. They speak
    of different times, or perhaps of different people, new successions
    from the continent, that drove out the former possessors who performed
    these works, more northward and westward. The works themselves are
    an evidence of the genius of the founders. Learning commonly arrives
    at its height within no long space of time. These works here have a
    notorious grandeur of taste, a justness of plan, an apparent symmetry
    and a sufficient niceness in the execution: In compass very extensive,
    in effect magnificent and agreeable. The boldness of the imagination
    we cannot sufficiently admire. When this whole <i>area</i>, which is
    about four miles square, was entirely sacred ground, under the care
    and custody of the Druids, one of their great seminaries or academies,
    every where a fine turf, cover‚Äôd over with an infinite variety of
    barrows, it was a most agreeable scene, and merely a picture.</p>

  <p>When one traverses about this ground, an intelligent person will
    discern abundance of remarkable beauties in the manner and disposition
    of the temple. The wise Druids knew the internal meaning and purport
    of this great symbol of the fecundity of the deity, first exerted in
    producing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
    second person represented thereby, who with them was the
    creator of all things. From the supreme proceeded the divine essences
    equal to himself; but the son of the supreme formed the material words,
    whence call‚Äôd the <i>mind</i>, the <i>creator</i>, and the <i>wisdom
    of the father</i>, both by the Druids and us christians. And never
    since the creation, was so magnificent an idea form‚Äôd in mortal minds,
    as this hieroglyphic here before us made in stone-work. This snake of
    ours may be near three of our common miles in length, justly laid down,
    its proportions adapted to nature, its sinuosity well represented in
    huge curves running contrary ways, conduced over several elevations and
    depressures of ground. Two hills, one on each side the stream running
    from <i>Abury</i> to <i>Silbury</i>, hide the view of the avenues from
    each other. So that probably the vulgar then knew not the true figure
    of the whole, no more than now. But those that approached this place
    with a purpose of religion, and that understood the mystical meaning
    thereof, must be extremely affected with it; the greatest picture, no
    doubt, on the globe of the earth, naturally exciting in their minds
    that disposition proper for those approaches!</p>

  <p>2. I observe that <i>Abury</i>, even now, lays its claim to
    all the old appendages: the bounds of the parish taking in
    chiefly all that the snake reaches, and the environs, as
    <i>Southstreet</i>, <i>West-Kennet</i>, and <i>Bekamton</i>, and
    part of <i>Winterburn-basset</i>, and <i>Stan-more</i> south of
    <i>Winterburn-basset</i>, (they say it has been a town;) and
    <i>Overton-hill</i>, <i>South-downs</i>, <i>West-downs</i>,
    <i>Cheril-hill</i>, almost to <i>Oldbury-castle</i>.</p>

  <p>3. I remark, tho‚Äô the people know nothing of the figure of a snake
    made by the two avenues, yet a notion has been handed down from all
    times, that gives an obscure hint of the thing, and of the prophylactic
    virtue in this figure of the snake. For they say, that in all this
    trail of ground, which we may call the <i>sacred field</i>, there never
    was a snake seen; and if a snake should be brought hither, it would
    not live. Nevertheless snakes abound in all the country round, even
    to <i>Clatford</i>, between <i>Marlborough</i> and here, but never
    come higher up. This notion, I know not whether ‚Äôtis justly founded,
    but ‚Äôtis deeply rooted in the mind of the inhabitants. <i>Pliny</i>
    has a great deal about the Druids‚Äô fondness of snakes, but a little
    unintelligible, as we find most of what authors have said concerning
    them. And we must be content at this time, to mark out some obscure
    traces of things that seem to our purpose, relating to this affair of
    theirs, which shall be the subject of the next chapters.</p>

  <p>4. When we contemplate the manner and disposition of our temple, in
    regard to its parts in the circle at <i>Abury</i>, and in regard to its
    position upon the cardinal points, some questions arise in our mind,
    which we desire a resolution of: Concerning which I believe the hints
    following will give us some satisfaction. Ever since the world began,
    in building temples or places of religious assemblies, they have been
    studious in setting them according to the quarters of the heavens. For
    they consider‚Äôd the world as the general temple or house of God, and
    that all particular temples should have a proper regard to it. The east
    naturally claims a prerogative, where the sun and all the planets and
    stars arise: this therefore they accounted as the face and front of
    the world, or universal temple. The north then was consider‚Äôd as the
    right-hand and great power of the world, the south as the left-hand or
    lesser power. For when the sun approaches the northern region, passing
    over the vernal equinoctial, he brings plenty, and the fulness of his
    fructiferous influence; when he returns to the south, the face of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>nature languishes in its winter attire. Therefore they thought the
    polar region not only highest, but of most eminence and effect.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Whence <i>Orpheus</i>: ‚ÄúThou who holdest the scepter of the pole,
    venerable on many accounts, the throne of the world in the north.‚Äù</p>

  <p><i>Psellus</i> says, ‚Äúthe <i>Pandochean</i> power of the world reigns
    in the north.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Hence <i>Plutarch</i> writes, ‚ÄúThat <i>Xenophon</i> says of the
    <i>Egyptians</i>, they thought that part where the sun rises was the
    face of the world; the north was its right-hand, where the <i>Nile</i>
    rises its left.‚Äù And this helps us to explain several <i>Egyptian</i>
    antiquities.</p>

  <p>But to apply this to our purpose. We cannot but observe, that the whole
    of <i>Abury</i> temple, or <i>Mausoleum</i>, regarded as a picture,
    has its upper part to the north, and its face (if we may so speak)
    toward the east. Thitherward the serpent goes. That way the cove of the
    northern temple opens; that way the cove of <i>Bekamton</i> avenue;
    that way the face of <i>Stonehenge</i> temple looks. So that the Druids
    appear to have the same notions with the other wise men of the oriental
    ancients.</p>

  <p>This therefore shews the reason why they set their temples fronting
    the east, in all antiquity, and why the coves of our works look that
    way. As to the two temples at <i>Abury</i>, the northern and southern,
    included in the great circle, it should seem that the northern one had
    the preeminence, and was the more sacred of the two. As the cove was
    the <i>adytum</i> of that temple, so the whole northern temple may be
    esteem‚Äôd as the <i>adytum</i> of the whole work, the southern being
    as the body of it. <i>Solomon</i>‚Äôs temple, we know, consisted of
    three parts: the <i>adytum</i>, or <i>holy of holies</i>; the <i>holy
      place</i>, or <i>sanctuary</i>; the <i>porch</i>. By this means there
    is a conformity between it and <i>Abury</i>; and to <i>Stonehenge</i>
    likewise, which has an elliptic <i>adytum</i>, a circular or outer
    part, and the <i>area</i>. Doubtless the different order of priests,
    and of religious offices, took up these different parts. And, if we may
    give our opinion, ‚Äôtis natural to think, that because the ring-stone
    is by the southern temple, there the sacrifices were offer‚Äôd and
    administer‚Äôd by the lesser orders of priests, around the <i>ambre</i>
    or central pyramidal. The highest part of religion was to be perform‚Äôd
    by the archdruid and the upper order of priests before the magnificent
    cove of the northern temple, together with hymns, incense, musick, and
    the like.</p>

  <p>5. In my account of <i>Stonehenge</i> I suggested a surmise, that
    the Druids, in laying down these works of theirs, used a compass
    or magnetic instrument; whence I founded a conjecture concerning
    the time of building that temple, by observing the variation with a
    theodolite. As the variation in all the works about <i>Stonehenge</i>
    is between six and seven degrees to the east of the north, I found it
    at <i>Abury</i> to be about ten degrees the same way, and as precisely
    as possible. This will necessarily excite one‚Äôs attention, as there is
    less reason to suppose ‚Äôtis accidental. The whole work was manifestly
    design‚Äôd to be set on the cardinal points of the heavens, but they all
    vary one way, exactly the same quantity; and ‚Äôtis impossible to account
    for it in any wise, but that they us‚Äôd a magnetic instrument. This is
    the reason that the neck of the snake on <i>Overton-hill</i> crosses
    the <i>Roman</i> road running east and west, which would otherwise have
    been the ground-line of this work.</p>

  <p>Thus <i>Kennet</i> avenue enters the town of <i>Abury</i> ten degrees
    north of the north-west point, which north-west point was the Druids‚Äô
    purpose. The neck of the snake going down from <i>Overton-hill</i>
    regards <i>Silbury</i> precisely, and their intent was that it should
    be full west, but ‚Äôtis ten degrees north of the west. The meridian line
    of the whole work passes from <i>Silbury-hill</i> to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> the center of
    the temple at <i>Abury</i>, this varies ten degrees to the east from
    the north-point. The stupendous cove in the northern temple opens ten
    degrees east of north-east. It was their purpose that it should regard
    the north-east. The diameter of the great circle of the great stones
    at <i>Abury</i>, on which the north and south temples are built, was
    design‚Äôd to have been set on the line from north-west to south-east,
    but it verges ten degrees northward; and so of all other particulars.
    And by this very means we may, at any time, point out the line of the
    termination of <i>Bekamton</i> avenue, tho‚Äô entirely destroy‚Äôd. For
    from <i>Silbury-hill</i>, it was design‚Äôd by the Druids to have been
    set full west, as <i>Overton-hill</i> full east. Therefore a line
    mark‚Äôd from <i>Silbury-hill</i>, ten degrees north of the west point,
    and at the proper length of the avenue, being 4000 cubits, an eastern
    mile, determines the spot where <i>Bekamton</i> avenue ended. That
    spot is south of the square inclosure going up to <i>Cheril-hill</i>,
    where <i>Silbury-hill</i> bears ten degrees south of east, where
    <i>Abury</i> steeple bears twenty-five degrees west of south-west. From
    <a href="#tab_XXI"><i>Silbury-hill</i></a> you mark it by the line that goes to <i>Oldbury</i>
    camp, on the left hand of <i>Cheril-hill</i>. In that line was the
    termination of <i>Bekamton</i> avenue; it being the intention of the
    Druids to place the founder‚Äôs <i>tumulus</i> or <i>mausoleum</i> of
    <i>Silbury-hill</i> in the middle, between the two ends of the avenue,
    the head and tail of the snake, upon the east and west line, and
    exactly south of the center of the great circle at <i>Abury</i>. This
    whole work therefore was properly the <i>mausoleum</i>, or made, as it
    were, one <i>tumulus</i> over the founder. A prophylactic form‚Äôd by the
    great symbol of the deity, guarded the ashes of the deceased hero. And
    from this custom in mythologic times, they invented the notion of a
    snake being the genius of departed heroes; or of such being turn‚Äôd into
    snakes and the like, as is said of <i>Cadmus</i>, and many more.</p>

  <p>Thus <i>Virgil</i> describing <i>√Üneas</i> celebrating the anniversary
    of his father‚Äôs death, at his <i>tumulus</i> in <i>Sicily</i>, recites
    the ancient rites practis‚Äôd at these places and on these occasions,
    and introduces a snake creeping out of the <i>adytum</i> of the
    <i>tumulus</i>, passing by the altars and holy utensils, and retiring
    again, in <i>√Üneid</i> V.</p>

  <p>Much might I recite to our purpose out of the ancient commentators

    a cove built upon it, as that we describ‚Äôd at <a href="#tab_VII"><i>Rowldrich</i></a>. But to
    return.</p>

  <p>I apprehend the reader will scarce excuse me, if I make not some
    inference from that observation of the variation of the needle here
    from the cardinal points. Indeed in these works of antiquity, I would
    be as temperate as possible in multiplying conjectures; and to nothing
    more can I pretend in this case, and that too but in gross, for we want
    sufficient <i>data</i>. A future age may pronounce with more certainty,
    when we know the entire revolution of the circle of the magnetic
    variation.</p>

  <p>Dr. <i>Halley</i> supposes the whole period is perform‚Äôd in about
    the space of 700 years. I am sufficiently satisfy‚Äôd from considering
    the different effect of the weather between <i>Abury</i> and
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, the great diversity in the manner of the works,
    and some other considerations, that <i>Abury</i> must be above 700
    years prior in time to <i>Stonehenge</i>. But if we take two entire
    revolutions, 1400 years, and set it 460 years before the christian
    <i>√¶ra</i>, the supposed time of the building of <i>Stonehenge</i>, it
    brings us, in <i>Usher</i>‚Äôs chronology, which, I take to be the best,
    to the year of the death of <i>Sarah</i>, <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs wife, which
    happen‚Äôd in the summer time of the 1859th year before Christ. This was
    a little before the time of <i>Inachus</i>.</p>

  <p>By the best light I can obtain, I judge our <i>Tyrian Hercules</i> made
    his expedition into the ocean, about the latter end of <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs
    time: and most likely ‚Äôtis, that <i>Abury</i> was the first great
    temple of <i>Britain</i>, and made by the first <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> colony
    that came hither; and they made it in this very place on account of the
    stones of the gray-weathers, so commodious for their purpose.</p>

  <p><i>Usher</i> makes this retirement of the <i>Hycsi</i>, or royal
    pastors out of <i>Egypt</i>, which was done by our <i>Hercules</i>, to
    be 34 years after that date. But my numbers make it somewhat later.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">IN</span> my description of <i>Abury</i>, and its parts, I endeavour‚Äôd to make
    every thing as plain as I could from fact and view; but now we come
    to our speculative part, I can only propose to entertain, perhaps,
    the reader‚Äôs curiosity, with what light I could gather from ancient
    learning concerning it.</p>

  <p>We have seen by our description, that the plan on which <i>Abury</i>
    is built, is that sacred hierogram of the <i>Egyptians</i>, and other
    ancient nations, the circle and snake. The whole figure is the circle,
    snake, and wings. By this they meant to picture out, as well as they
    could, the nature of the divinity. The circle meant the supreme
    fountain of all being, the father; the serpent, that divine emanation
    from him which was called the son; the wings imported that other divine
    emanation from them which was called the spirit, the <i>anima mundi</i>.</p>

  <p>This is that figure which <i>Kircher</i> names <i>ophio
      cyclo-pterygomorphos</i>, and discourses largely of. But that we may
    have a better understanding of it than hitherto has been, we shall open
    our mind concerning this abstruse matter by degrees.</p>

  <p><i>Dracontia</i> was a name among the first learned nations, for the
    very ancient sort of temples, of which they could give no account,
    nor well explain their meaning upon it. <i>Strabo</i> XIV. this was a
    name of this kind of patri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>archal temple, of which <i>Abury</i> is
    one, deduc‚Äôd to later times, whilst the thing itself, and manner of
    building, was disus‚Äôd and forgot.</p>

  <p><i>Servius</i> on the second <i>√Üneid</i>, writes, ‚Äú<i>anguis</i>
    is a proper name of the water-snake, <i>serpens</i> of the land,
    <i>draco</i> of those belonging to temples.‚Äù By which, ultimately,
    our representations must be meant, tho‚Äô probably by the author not
    understood, as having no acquaintance with our kind of works. But it
    unavoidably brings to our mind the temples of the ancients kept by
    dragons, which we so frequently meet with in classical history. And
    we may well presume they mean such temples as this of <i>Abury</i>,
    <i>Dracontia</i>.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúThe serpent,‚Äù says <i>Maximus</i> of <i>Tyre</i>, <i>Dissert.</i>
    38. ‚Äúwas the great symbol of the deity to most nations, and as
    such was worshipped by the Indians.‚Äù The temples of old made in the
    form of a serpent, were called for that reason, <i>Dracontia</i>. The
    universality of this regard for serpents, shews the high antiquity of
    the symbol, and that it was antediluvian.</p>

  <p>To give us light into the affair, first it will be convenient to
    discourse a little concerning the nature of the serpent, and why
    mankind should make it a symbol of divinity. For it looks a little
    strange, after our first mother was seduc‚Äôd from her innocence, by the
    devil under this form, that so high a regard should be paid to it.</p>

  <p>The first learning in the world confided chiefly in symbols. The
    wisdom of the <i>Chaldeans</i>, <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>, <i>Egyptians</i>,
    <i>Jews</i>, of <i>Zoroaster</i>, <i>Sanchoniathon</i>, <i>Pherecydes
    Syrus</i>, <i>Pythagoras</i>, <i>Socrates</i>, <i>Plato</i>, of all
    the ancients, that is come to our hand, is symbolic. ‚ÄúIt was the
    mode,‚Äù says <i>Serranus</i>, on <i>Plato</i>‚Äôs <i>Symposium</i>, ‚Äúof
    the ancient philosophers, to represent truth by certain symbols and
    hidden images. It leads us gradually, sweetly, yet most efficaciously,
    towards the contemplation of the first being, which is the end of
    all philosophy and theology.‚Äù We may add, it was the method of
    ancient divines too, from the beginning to our Saviour‚Äôs time. No one
    cultivated it more than he, in all his sermons and discourses, which
    were affecting, well wrought up, lively, apposite, entertaining in the
    highest degree. Some of them complete <i>dramas</i>. And in general, we
    must conclude, it gives a beautiful gloss and amiable face to truth.</p>

  <p>That the Druids studied in this enigmatic and symbolic way, appears
    from what we are writing upon; and <i>Diogenes Laertius</i>, in
    his proem, affirms it of them. He ranks them with the <i>Magi</i>,
    <i>Chaldeans</i>, and <i>Gymnosophists</i>, gives some of their
    doctrines, and makes them rather ancienter than the <i>Egyptians</i>,
    meaning the learned among the <i>Egyptians</i>. He says, ‚Äúthe
    <i>Gymnosophists</i> are descended of the <i>Magi</i>, and some affirm
    the <i>Jews</i> too.‚Äù He means the ancestors of the <i>Jews</i>,
    <i>Abraham</i> in particular. I believe, Druids, <i>Chaldeans</i>,
    <i>Gymnosophists</i>, and <i>Egyptians</i>, all descended, or rather
    disciples of the <i>Magi</i>, who were the first and patriarchal
    priests after the flood. <i>Sanchoniathon</i> calls <i>Shem</i> (as
    I take it) by the name of <i>Magus</i>, as the prince of the order.
    He says the <i>Egyptians</i> vail their doctrines under the figure of
    beetles, <i>snakes</i>, birds, and other animals. And it seems to be
    the origin of animal worship in <i>Egypt</i>. Thus <i>Gale</i>, in his
    <i>court of the gentiles</i>, P. I. p. 64. again P. II. p. 35. ‚Äúthe
    ancient mode of expressing things worthy of memory, by hieroglyphic
    forms, notes, and symbols, was very common amongst the ancients, in the
    oriental parts especially, both poets and philosophers; and exceeding
    proper for that infant state of the world, wherein knowledge was so
    imperfect and impolite. And we need no way doubt but that this symbolic
    kind of discourse, or language, had its original from the divine
    ≈ìconomy which God prescribed in his infant church,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> consisting of many
    terrene images and sensible forms, symbols and types, for the shadowing
    forth highest contemplations and heavenly mysteries. Which way of
    conveying and preserving knowledge is not only helpful to the memory,
    grateful to the fancy and judgment, but also very efficacious for the
    moving of the affections.‚Äù</p>

  <p>A symbol is an arbitrary, sensible sign of an intellectual idea. And
    I believe the art of writing at first was no other, than that of
    making symbols, pictures, or marks of things they wanted to express.
    So that every letter was the picture of an idea. This was the first
    and antediluvian way of writing, before alphabet writing was invented.
    This latter was a postdiluvian invention, in my opinion. The reasons
    I shall give on another more immediate occasion. <i>Servius</i>, on
    the <i>√Üneid</i> V. <i>septem ingens gyros</i>, speaking of the snake
    encompassing <i>Anchises</i>‚Äôs tomb, writes, that this method was prior
    to alphabet-writing. I believe the <i>Chinese</i> method of writing
    to be the antediluvian one; and the like, perhaps, may be affirmed of
    the <i>Egyptian</i> hieroglyphics. The <i>Egyptians</i> had the good
    sense, when alphabet writing was communicated to them, to embrace it,
    tho‚Äô the <i>Chinese</i> will not. Still the <i>Egyptians</i> retain‚Äôd
    a particular veneration for their former method, and dedicated it to
    sacred uses altogether.</p>

  <p>This symbol of the snake and circle, which is the picture of the temple
    of <i>Abury</i>, we see on innumerable <i>Egyptian</i> monuments.
    Always it holds the uppermost, the first and chief place; which shews
    its high dignity.</p>

  <p>Mr. Selden, upon the <i>Arundel marbles</i>, p. 132, says, ‚Äúthis figure
    in abbreviated writing, among the <i>Greeks</i>, signifies <span lang="el">ŒîŒ±ŒπŒºœâŒΩ</span>, the
    <i>deity</i>.‚Äù <img class="iglyph-b" src="images/i_056ch.png" alt="" /> And Kircher, in his third tome, affirms the
    like of the <i>Brachmans</i> of the <i>East-Indies</i>.
  </p>

  <p>I can by no means admit it to be an <i>Egyptian invention</i>. The
    <i>Egyptians</i> took this, and hieroglyphic writing in general, from
    the common ancestors of mankind. This is sufficiently prov‚Äôd from the
    universality of the thing, reaching from <i>China</i> in the east, to
    <i>Britain</i> in the west, nay, and into <i>America</i> too.</p>

  <p>Nothing of so high account among the <i>Chinese</i>, as the
    representation of dragons and serpents, as we see in all their pictures
    and utensils; nay, the very stamps upon their ink. ‚ÄôTis the genial
    banner of their empire. It means every thing that is sacred among
    them. In baron <i>Vischer</i>‚Äôs elegant book of ancient architecture,
    Tab. XV. you have the picture of a <i>Chinese</i> triumphal arch (of
    which there are many in the city of <i>Pekin</i>) twice upon it is
    pictur‚Äôd, in a tablet over the front, a circle and two snakes, as
    on <i>Egyptian</i> works. They adorn their temples, houses, habits,
    and every thing with this figure, as a common <i>prophylaxis</i>. I
    apprehend it was from the beginning a sacred amuletic character. ‚ÄôTis
    carv‚Äôd several times on the cornishes of the temple (I take it so to
    be) of <i>Persepolis</i>, as we see in Sir <i>John Chardin</i>, <i>Le
    Brun</i>, <i>K√¶mfer</i>. Dragons were the <i>Parthian</i> ensigns, from
    whom the <i>Romans</i> in later times took them, and our <i>saxon</i>
    ancestors from the <i>Romans</i>. ‚ÄôTis a known verse in the satyrist,</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Druids had no less a veneration for it, as we find by <i>Abury</i>
    and by their fondness of snake stone beads and the like, which
    <i>Pliny</i> calls snakes‚Äô eggs, and discourses on, largely, in
    relation to our Druids.

  <p>We may satisfy our selves about this difficulty, by considering, 1. the
    natural history of the serpent, and 2. the nature of forming of symbols.</p>

  <p>First, the natural history of this animal. Can we divest our selves
    of original prejudice, we must allow the serpent kind, as to their
    outward <i>appearance</i>, among the most beautiful creatures in the
    world. The poets, those great masters of nature, are luxuriant in their
    descriptions of them, comparing them to the most glorious appearance in
    the universe, the rainbow. Thus <i>Virgil √Üneid</i> V.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Of <i>Cadmus</i>‚Äôs snake.</p>

  <p><i>Heph√¶stion</i> II. writes concerning the <i>Hydra</i> of
    <i>Hercules</i>, that half his head was of gold. I saw a snake of such
    exquisite beauty in <i>Surrey</i>. The motion and the appearance or
    bright golden colour, being so like to angelick, seraphick beings;
    no wonder the ancients conceiv‚Äôd so high a regard for the serpent,
    as to reckon it a most divine animal. There is a kind of them bred
    in <i>Arabia</i> and <i>Africa</i>, of a shining yellow colour, like
    brass, or burnish‚Äôd gold, which in motion reflects the sun-beams
    with inconceivable lustre. Some of them are said to have wings,
    called <i>Seraphs</i>, <i>Saraphs</i>, <i>Seraphim</i>, mention‚Äôd
    <i>Deut.</i> xii. 15. this is the name given to the brazen serpent.
    And equally to the angels and celestial messengers, who are described
    of this appearance, in scripture. So the cherubim that supported the
    <i>Shechinah</i> in <i>Ezekiel</i> i. 7. ‚Äúsparkled like the colour of
    burnished brass.‚Äù The divine appearance between the candlesticks in
    <i>Apocalypse</i> i. 15. ‚ÄúHis feet were like to fine brass, as if they
    burned in a furnace.‚Äù Hence his ministers are called a flame of fire.
    <i>Psalm</i> civ. 4.</p>

  <p>Secondly, consider the <i>motion</i> of a serpent,‚Äôtis wonderful;
    perform‚Äôd without the help of legs, nay incomparably quicker than
    their kindred of the crocodile and lizard kind, which have four legs:
    ‚Äôtis swift, smooth, wavy, and beautiful. The ancients conceiv‚Äôd it to
    be like the walking of the gods; whence the notion of deify‚Äôd heroes,
    with serpents‚Äô feet. <i>Pherecydes Syrus</i> says, the gods have
    snakes‚Äô feet: meaning their motion was smooth and sweeping, without the
    alternate use of legs.</p>

  <p><i>Heliodorus</i> III. speaks of the wavy motion of the gods, not
    by opening their feet, but with a certain aerial force; it was
    call‚Äôd <i>incessus</i>. <i>Non ambulamus, sed incedimus</i>, says
    <i>Seneca</i>.</p>

  <p>So the prophet <i>Ezekiel</i> describes the motion of the alate globes
    under the cherubims‚Äô feet; as it ought to be understood, <i>Ezek.</i>
    i. 12. <i>Sanchoniathon</i> the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> in <i>Euseb.</i> <i>p.
    e.</i> I. 7. writes, that the nature of serpents is divine. ‚Äú‚ÄôTis
    the most spiritual animal of all and fiery; that it performs all its
    various motions by its spirit, without other organs;‚Äù and much more of
    this kind, to our purpose. <i>Jerem.</i> xlvi. 22. The shout and the
    march of an army is compar‚Äôd to the motion of a serpent.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, from the form, pass we to the <i>mind</i> of the serpent, if
    we may be allowed so to talk. The wisdom of this creature is celebrated
    from the time of creation itself. <i>Moses</i> writes, it was more
    subtle than any other creature, <i>Genes.</i> iii. 1. Our Saviour
    recommends to the ministry, to imitate the prudence of serpents, as
    well as the innocence of doves: he makes it the symbol of Christian
    prudence. The psalmist compares the slyness of the wicked to the
    serpent, which refuses to be charmed. <i>Aristotle</i> writes, that
    this animal is very crafty; but if we inquire into authors, concerning
    this wisdom of the creature, nothing occurs satisfactory: in truth ‚Äôtis
    figurative and symbolical; meaning the charm of rhetorick and oratory,
    taken from the divided tongue of this creature, and more especially
    regarding the preachers of evangelical truths: <span lang="el">Œ¥ŒπŒ≥ŒªœâœÉœÉŒØŒ±</span> among the
    antients was prudence. Our Saviour in the forecited place of the
    apocalypse, is represented with a two-edged sword in his mouth, meaning
    the efficacy of preaching. The people affirmed, ‚Äúnever man spake like
    this man;‚Äù and he sent the divine spirit of eloquence and languages
    upon his apostles, in the likeness of cloven tongues of fire.</p>

  <p><i>Servius</i> on the second <i>√Üneid</i>, speaking of the tongue of
    <i>Laocoon</i>‚Äôs serpent,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry" lang="la">
      <div class="stanza">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Says <i>Ovid</i> of <i>Cadmus</i>‚Äôs snake.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>The tongue was the only active arms of the apostles, as the bifid
    tongue of the serpent is its only weapon; and which, as the ancients
    thought, carried life and death with it.</p>

  <p>From the numerous and credible accounts I have seen, snakes, I am
    persuaded, have a power of charming, by looking steadfastly with their
    fiery eyes, on birds, mice, and such creatures as they prey upon.
    They are put into such an agony, as to run by degrees into their open
    mouth. Further, snakes were thought to have an inchanting power, not
    only with their eyes, but likewise by whispering into the ears: for
    by that whispering they communicated a prophetick and divine spirit.
    The scholiast of <i>Euripides</i> writes, of <i>Helenus</i> and
    <i>Cassandra</i>, that serpents licking their ears, so sharpened their
    hearing, that <i>they</i> only could hear the counsels of the gods;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>and became great prophets thereby. This incantation by the ears, is
    elegantly apply‚Äôd by the fathers, in their writings, to the preachers
    of the gospel, and to our Saviour himself. <i>Clemens in p√¶dagog.</i>
    V. calls him <span lang="el">ŒïœÄœâŒ¥·Ω∏œÇ</span> the inchanter, as the learned <i>Spanheim</i>
    observes: and often St. <i>Chrysostom</i> uses the like expression.</p>

  </div>

  <p>All these put together, I take to be some good reasons (to omit
    several more for brevity‚Äôs sake) for the extraordinary veneration
    paid to this creature, from all antiquity. Our oldest heathen
    writer <i>Sanchoniathon</i> says, the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> call‚Äôd it
    <i>agathod√¶mon</i>, the good angel. <i>Epies</i> the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i>
    in <i>Eusebius</i> pronounces it a most divine animal. <i>Maximus</i>
    of <i>Tyre</i> before quoted writes, that the serpent was the great
    symbol of the deity, in most nations, even among the <i>Indians</i>.
    <i>Sigismund</i> in his <i>Muscovite</i>-history, says the like of
    the <i>Samogitians</i>, in the northern parts of that vast empire.
    <i>Gaguin</i> in his <i>Sarmatia</i>, of the <i>Lithuanians</i>. So
    <i>Scaliger</i> in his notes on <i>Aristotle</i> of animals, concerning
    the people of <i>Calicut</i> in the <i>East-Indies</i>; all books of
    travels into the <i>West-Indies</i>, the like. This sufficiently proves
    the notion nearly as old as mankind.</p>

  <p>From these notions in antiquity, arose the strange humour of the ophite
    sect or heresy, who affirm the seducer serpent was the son of God.
    <i>Epiphanius</i>, <i>Tertullian</i>, St. <i>Augustin</i> and others
    speak of it. They kept a serpent in a box and worshipped it.</p>

  <p>2. We are to consider the nature of forming of symbols. The serpent
    simply, as it was curs‚Äôd of God, and composite, as hanging on a tree,
    was symbolical of Christ: according to the sense both of <i>Jewish</i>
    and Christian writers.</p>

  <p>We have seen the serpent in very advantageous light, which was in
    order to remove our prejudice, by the high notion its natural history
    presents us, to which much might have been added. But this is not
    necessary in the formation of symbols, for if we should think this a
    mean and contemptible animal, unworthy to convey to us so great an
    idea, I answer, it was one of the arts of the inventors of symbols
    and emblems, to picture out the highest things by what we may esteem
    the lowest subjects: a beetle, for instance, is the symbol of no less
    than what the heathen call <i>anima mundi</i>; and to picture out the
    greatest good by its contrary. Just as <i>Isaiah</i> in the prophetical
    style calls that most excellent prince king <i>Hezekiah</i>, by the
    name of dragon, basilisk, cockatrice, and fiery flying serpent,
    xiv. 26. This is understood not in regard to any pravity of his own
    disposition, but in regard to the enemies of God‚Äôs people, to whom
    he was as a dragon, a divine avenger against enemies, a protector of
    his own. Again consider the serpent as a prophylactick symbol, and
    the highest of sacred characters, thought most effectually to guard
    against and drive off all evil power. It was the method in making
    these prophylactick symbols, to take the figure of the thing we want
    to remedy. A most remarkable and apposite instance of this nature, is
    the famous brazen serpent erected by <i>Moses</i>, being suspended on
    a cross-pole, like that on which military banners are hung. They that
    were bitten by the fiery serpents, were order‚Äôd to look on this, and be
    whole. So that manifestly the symbol is to excite faith and obedience.
    They are the proper cure, not the intrinsick efficacy of the symbolical
    figure, <i>Wisd.</i> xvi. 6, 7.</p>

  <p>All writers <i>Jewish</i> and Christian with one mouth assert, this
    was a type of the Messiah. <i>Philo</i> is in a rapture about it;
    supposes somewhat extraordinary, future, is meant thereby. <i>Rabbi
    Moses Gerundinensis</i> writes thus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> ‚ÄúIt seems to me, concerning
    this mystery, that ‚Äôtis agreeable to the course of the divine law,
    as to miraculous works, that the mischief should be remedied by a
    thing similar to that which caus‚Äôd it.‚Äù And it makes the miracle more
    illustrious and divine, that God should direct a snake to cure those
    bitten by snakes.</p>

  <p>Others of the rabbin are of the same way of thinking, as <i>David
    Kimchi</i>, <i>Michlol</i> II. And <i>Abarbenel</i> upon the place,
    f. 305. And <i>Nachmanides</i>. Our Saviour applies the <i>Mosaic</i>
    serpent directly to himself; no wonder then that the Christian fathers
    do so. <i>Christus veluti serpens in cruce pependit</i>, says St.
    <i>Ambrose</i>. <i>Moebius</i> treats largely of this resemblance
    between <i>Christ</i> and the serpent, <i>exercitatio de √¶neo
    serpente</i>, p. 63. Highly honour‚Äôd was the serpent, that, as it had
    been the instrument of introducing the greatest evil to mankind, to
    it was directed God‚Äôs word when he promised to us the greatest good,
    the Messiah, imply‚Äôd in those words, <i>Gen.</i> iii. 15. He <i>shall
    bruise thy head</i>: <span lang="el">Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÇ</span> in the LXX.</p>

  <p>Another like case is that in 1 <i>Samuel</i> v. the ark of God was
    taken captive by the <i>Philistines</i>, and they dar‚Äôd to look
    into the venerable secrecy thereof. The nation was smote in the
    hinder-parts, the organs of generation, which the scripture modestly
    calls <i>emerods</i>, <i>h√¶morrhoidals</i>. Moreover a terrible
    pestilence killed many, and a plague of mice at harvest-time came upon
    them, and devoured all the fruit of their ground. In order to make
    an atonement, they sent away the ark again, with golden figures of
    the emerods and mice, a present accompanying of costly jewels, as a
    consecrated <span lang="el">ŒªŒøœÖœÑœÅŒøŒΩ</span>, or satisfaction to the God of the <i>Jews</i>.
    Here, by the way, we should be blind if we did not see the origin of
    the <i>phallus</i> among the heathen.</p>

  <p>Therefore to apply this. In regard to the seeming difficulty we at
    first took notice of, paying such a regard to an animal which the
    ancestors of mankind had so much reason to detest. Did the devil injure
    us under the form of a serpent? The like figure is the properest of
    any to symbolize the remedy, the antidote against the poison whereby
    the devil wrought man‚Äôs fall. Therefore, naturally, the same is to
    symbolize the Messiah then promised, who is to work man‚Äôs redemption.
    And St. <i>Athanasius</i>, Tom. II. <i>qu√¶st.</i> 20. scruples not to
    make a comparison between the union of the serpent and the devil, in
    the fatal temptation; to the union of the divine and human nature in
    our blessed Saviour. The venomous serpent is his human nature, sinful,
    infected by the devil‚Äôs treachery; <i>he was made sin for us</i>, tho‚Äô
    not contaminated himself. Tho‚Äô not venomous, he cures the venom of our
    nature. I observe that the <i>rabbies</i>, tho‚Äô they saw sufficiently,
    how necessarily the <i>Mosaic</i> serpent was applicable to the
    Messiah, yet they were somewhat fearful therein, and of speaking their
    mind upon it, for fear of doing ill, in comparing him to an accursed
    animal. But our Saviour himself was not fearful in comparing himself
    to it, and the rather on that account, took it for a very express
    type of his crucifixion, and of his being accursed for our sakes,
    <i>Deut.</i> xxi. 25. <i>John</i> iii. 14. <i>Galat.</i> iii. 13, <i>i.
    e.</i> devoted as a sacrifice, an expiation, that we being freed from
    the curse of sin, might obtain the blessing of God. So our Christian
    writers explain the type between our Saviour and the brazen serpent
    in the wilderness. <i>Bede</i> in particular, on <i>John</i> iii. And
    here we see the nature of types, where a man that undergoes the curse
    and punishment of the law, becomes in reality a type of the Messiah. A
    serpent which pictures out the evil principle, the like, 2 <i>Cor.</i>
    v. 21. Assuredly <i>Moses</i>, by the holy Spirit, meant it to regard
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>Christ‚Äôs crucifixion. A fit emblem of his divinity, thro‚Äô that
    remarkable quality of their throwing off old age with their skin, and
    returning to youth again. For so the ancients thought:

  <p>No wonder then, from such reasons as these, and others as obvious,
    the ancients concluded this to be the most divine of all animals,
    and thought it the aptest symbol of the <span lang="el">ŒùŒøœÖœÇ ·ºëœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ</span>, the other, or
    second mind of <i>Plato</i>, whom they affirmed to be the creator of
    the world. I know not whether this notion of theirs did not farther
    contribute to it; they thought these animals brought forth by the
    mouth. They have too no limbs, or members for action, but exert their
    mighty power by the mouth only; whence <i>Horus Apollo</i> says, ‚Äúa
    serpent is the symbol of the mouth.‚Äù This well represents the omnific

  <p class="drop-cap"><i>ZOroaster Magus, in Euseb. p. e.</i> II. 7. <i>Plato</i>,
    <i>Porphyry</i>, and others of the old philosophers, define God to
    be every where and no where, who fills all space, and is contain‚Äôd
    in none; ‚Äúfrom whom came all things that are, and which are not yet;
    eternal, immutable, omnipresent, incomprehensible, immaterial, without
    parts, beginning or end.‚Äù If we put this definition into a geometrical
    figure, in order to form a symbol, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> cannot possibly do it better
    than by describing the circle. A circle then in hieroglyphics means,
    divine; but particularly, as it is the most perfect and comprehensive
    of all geometrical figures, they design‚Äôd it for the symbol of the
    first and supreme being; whose resemblance we cannot find, whose center
    is every where, and circumference no where. It well pictur‚Äôd out, as
    <i>Abenephi</i> the <i>Arabian</i> and others assert, the divine nature
    of God.</p>

  <p>Therefore this figure of the serpent and circle in their doctrine,
    aptly means the divine creator, or the creator descended from the
    supreme. For tho‚Äô the deity was author of all things, yet more
    immediately this <span class="gespertt1">SON</span> or <span class="gespertt1">WORD</span> of the supreme was the architect of the
    universe.</p>

  <p>And this we find exactly consonant to the scripture doctrine. So that
    it seems very evident to me, the most important of divine truths
    admitted in the christian church, were imparted to the first race of
    mankind, the patriarchal church, which two are in reality but the same.</p>

  <p>We learn repeatedly from <i>Sanchoniathon</i>, <i>Porphyry</i>, and
    other ancient authors quoted by <i>Eusebius</i> in the <i>pr√¶paratio
    evangelica</i>, that the first sages of the world had just and
    true notions of the nature of the deity, conformable to those of
    the Christians: That, in their hieroglyphic way of writing, they
    design‚Äôd the deity and the mysterious nature thereof, by the sacred
    figure of the circle, snake, and wings. Of these, the circle meant
    the fountain of all being, the invisible supreme, who had no name.
    The serpent symboliz‚Äôd the son, or first divine emanation from the
    supreme. This they called by the name of <i>Ptha</i>, which is deriv‚Äôd
    from the <i>hebrew</i>, meaning the <span class="gespertt1">WORD</span>. The wings symboliz‚Äôd that
    divine person or emanation from the former, commonly called <i>anima
    mundi</i>, but the <i>Egyptians</i> called him <span class="gespertt1">KNEPH</span>, which in
    <i>hebrew</i> signifies <i>winged</i>.</p>

  <p>Thus the old authors that speak of these things are to be understood,
    though they are confus‚Äôd, not rightly apprehending the bottom of
    the matter. And this hieroglyphic figure, in the whole, was call‚Äôd
    <i>Knephtha</i>.</p>

  <p>But this knowledge of the nature of the deity, the most valuable
    <i>depositum</i> which could be communicated to mortals, was first
    perverted into idolatry; therefore God almighty forbore revealing
    himself further on that head, in an explicit manner, ‚Äôtill the fulness
    of time arriv‚Äôd, the Christian dispensation. But those people who
    preserv‚Äôd themselves from idolatry, among which I reckon our Druids,
    retain‚Äôd that knowledge thereof which had already been imparted, of
    which this sacred figure of the alate and serpentiferous circle was, as
    it were, a seal; which they stamp‚Äôd upon these most lasting monuments,
    their temples. And I doubt not but they somewhat improv‚Äôd the notions
    they had thereof, by reasoning, in the manner I shall speak of <a href="#CHAP_XV">Chap. XV.</a></p>

  <p><i>Abury</i> is not the only temple in <i>Britain</i> form‚Äôd on this
    design of the circle and serpent. I saw another at <i>Shap</i> in
    <i>Westmorland</i>, when I travell‚Äôd thro‚Äô the place, <i>anno</i> 1725,
    with Mr. <i>Roger Gale</i>. But I had no opportunity of examining into
    it.</p>

  <p>There is another, as I take it, at <i>Classerness</i>, a village in the
    island of <i>Lewis</i>, between <i>Scotland</i> and <i>Ireland</i>.
    I took a drawing of it from Mr. <i>Lwydd</i>‚Äôs travels; but he was a
    very bad designer, and having no knowledge of the purport, makes the
    representation still worse. The circle to which it belongs is 20 cubits
    in diameter. There is a central obelisc. A part of the snake remains
    going from it, which he calls an avenue. He did not discern the curve
    of it, no more than that of <i>Kennet</i> avenue, which he likewise has
    drawn in the same collection, as a straight line. It seems to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>me
    that the circle was double, or two concentric. I shall print it in the
    succeeding volume.</p>

  <p>No doubt but there are more in the <i>britannic</i> isles. I propose in
    this chapter to deliver my notions concerning them in the more eastern
    parts of the world, of which are many traces in ancient writing;
    avoiding prolixity as much as possible.</p>

  <p>The practice of building these serpentine temples was us‚Äôd by the
    patriarchs, perhaps near the beginning of the world. I have some proof
    of their being ancienter than the flood; but shall not at present
    insist on it. The first person I shall take notice of on this account
    is <i>Phut</i>, a brother of <i>Canaan</i>, son of <i>Cham</i>.
    <i>Phut</i> was a person of much greater eminence in antiquity, than
    vulgarly thought. But would we know anything of the particular memoirs
    of this man, or of any other his relations and coevals, we have nothing
    left us for it but heathen story.</p>

  <p>Tho‚Äô the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>, and our Druids, as well as the
    <i>Egyptians</i> too, had the earliest use of alphabet writing, yet
    none of these nations have transmitted to us any memoirs of themselves.
    And for what little knowledge we have of them, besides their monuments,
    we are altogether indebted to the <i>Greeks</i>, that receiv‚Äôd these
    arts from them. They happily improv‚Äôd art and science, sculpture and
    writing, so as to hand down to us most of the ancient history we know,
    beside the bible. Still this misfortune attended them, that they
    improv‚Äôd the symbolical method of writing, which they learn‚Äôd from the
    <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> and <i>Egyptians</i>, to that monstrous pitch, as to
    produce what we call by the general name of <i>mythology</i>. It was
    but very late that they came to write true history: so that the whole
    of the ancient history of the nations they write of, is invelop‚Äôd in
    this perplexing mythology.</p>

  <p>Yet we should be highly to blame, if we absolutely neglected it. ‚ÄôTis
    all we can have of prophane antiquity. ‚ÄôTis more commendable for us
    to study to extricate it from its symbolic mystery, and find out the
    open truth. Those that have succeeded best therein, find much agreement
    between it and the scripture history, as far as they are concurrent.</p>

  <p>‚ÄôTis from this mythology, chiefly, that I can pretend to discourse any
    further, concerning these great works I have been describing. I shall
    endeavour to do it with all the brevity and perspicuity possible, as
    becomes such sort of discourses. Yet I despair not of finding out a
    good deal of true history. I shall not answer for all. And a great
    deal of candour is necessary in the reader, if he would have either
    pleasure or instruction in it. Yea, says a predecessor in these kind
    of inquiries, Dr. <i>Dickenson</i>, <i>Delph. Ph≈ìnic.</i> ‚Äúif we look
    over the <i>greek</i> mythology with proper sagacity, we shall easily
    discover many footsteps of true religion.‚Äù</p>

  <p>‚ÄúA fable is an artificial discourse, consisting of the marvellous,
    and a philosopher, in some sort, is a lover of such,‚Äù says the great
    philosopher, <i>Metaphys.</i> I. 2.</p>

  <p>There are vast treasures of ancient knowledge in mythology, especially
    of history both sacred and civil. ‚ÄôTis all that we have left of heathen
    history of the most ancient times, and ‚Äôtis worth our while to shake
    off the rubbish, and pick out the useful part. The learned labours
    of <i>Bochart</i>, <i>Selden</i>, <i>Marsham</i>, <i>Huetius</i>,
    <i>Gale</i>, <i>Cumberland</i>, <i>Banier</i>, and many more, shew us
    its utility. And we must pardon them if, in some things, they have gone
    beyond the golden medium, we ourselves will be content to err somewhat
    with those great names.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

  <p><i>Phut</i>, son of <i>Cham</i>, was a person of eminence, tho‚Äô not
    taken notice of so much as he deserves. I think it much to our purpose
    to recite some part of his history. He is the <i>Apollo</i> mention‚Äôd
    by <i>Sanchoniathon</i>, son of <i>Cronus</i>, who is <i>Cham</i>,
    as is demonstrated beyond doubt by bishop <i>Cumberland</i>, in his
    posthumous works; he is said to have been born in <i>Per√¶a</i>, i. e.
    the country towards the <i>Euphrates</i>: his third son; as likewise
    deliver‚Äôd by <i>Moses</i>. From the word <i>Phut</i>, he was called
    <i>Python</i>, by a little transposition natural in pronouncing a
    difficult name; and, by a like transposition, <i>Typhon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Apollo Pythius</i> was the son of <i>Ammon, that is Cham</i>, says
    <i>Lucius Ampelius</i>, <i>in libro memoriali</i>. <i>Plutarch de Isid.
    &amp; Osir.</i> writes, that <i>Typhon</i> was brother to <i>Osiris</i>,
    who was undoubtedly <i>Misraim</i>, son of <i>Cham</i>. The like by
    <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>.</p>

  <p>To facilitate the understanding of antiquity, I here present the reader
    with a genealogical table of the great personages we are going to treat
    of. I could produce the evidences that prove each particular descent,
    in a strictly heraldical way, but it would now take up too much of our
    time.</p>

  <p><i>Phut</i> was the first most celebrated navigator of antiquity, built
    a fleet of ships, began to carry colonies into the countries on the
    <i>Mediterranean</i> sea. <i>Strabo</i> in IX. tells us the history of
    him from <i>Ephorus</i>, a very ancient historian. He says <i>Phut</i>
    or <i>Apollo</i> travell‚Äôd the earth, and came to the rude inhabitants
    of <i>Parnassus</i>. His business was to bring men to civility and
    manners, to use corn for their food.</p>

  <p><i>Pindar</i> writes of him,</p>

  <p>&mdash;&mdash;<i>He travell‚Äôd o‚Äôer earth and sea, setting watch-towers on
    hill-tops, among the nations, consecrating temples, and building
    groves.</i></p>

  <p><i>Lycophron</i> mentions <i>Typhon</i>‚Äôs watch-towers <i>in
    Arimis</i>, which probably is the <i>Per√¶a</i> of <i>Sanchoniathon</i>,
    the east part of <i>Syria</i>, where <i>Homer</i> says the <span lang="el">ŒµœÖŒΩŒ∑</span>, or
    bed of <i>Typhon</i> was, in a field abounding with oaks. ‚ÄôTis not
    unusual for <i>Apollo</i> to be represented in the character of a
    military captain. <i>Hygin. fab.</i> 140. And he really was a leader of
    a vast colony of his people into <i>Egypt</i>, then possess‚Äôd by his
    elder brother <i>Misraim</i>. Of this more hereafter. Of him speaks
    <i>Seneca</i> in <i>Medea</i>,</p>

  <p><i>Jerem.</i> xlvi. 9. the <i>Libyans</i> of <i>Africa</i> are in
    the original <i>Phut</i>. The <i>Lydians</i> there are the people or
    posterity of <i>Lud</i>, <i>Thoth</i>, his brother.</p>

  <p><i>Apollodorus</i> I. 4. writes, that <i>Elios</i>, our <i>Phut</i>,
    married <i>Rhode</i> daughter of <i>Neptune</i>, who was really
    <i>Tarshish</i> son of <i>Javan</i>, son of <i>Japhet</i>. From her he
    denominated the celebrated island, where, to his honour, was erected
    by posterity, the most stupendous statue in brass that ever was in
    the world, in any metal or other matter; being seventy cubits in
    height, whence all great statues have been call‚Äôd <i>Colosses</i>. The
    <i>Argonauts</i> in <i>Apollonius</i> I. sacrifice to <i>Apollo</i>
    the patron of navigation; in <i>Artemidorus</i>, <i>Oniro</i> II. 35.
    call‚Äôd <i>Apollo Delphinius</i>; that author says it means <i>long
    voyages</i>. <i>Pausanias in B≈ìoticis</i> gives him the same sirname.
    Hence, I apprehend, the <i>dolphin</i>, his cognizance, was plac‚Äôd in
    the heavens.</p>

  <p>In face, he was like to <i>Augustus</i>. I have several <i>Rhodian</i>
    coins in silver and brass, of different sizes, in all which he
    is pictur‚Äôd. Nor need we be scrupulous in thinking them a good
    resemblance. For the <i>Telchines</i>, inhabitants of <i>Rhodes</i>,
    are said to be the first makers of images. And we may at this
    time of day, have the satisfaction of seeing an infinite number
    of representations of him, in the coins, busts, and images of
    <i>Augustus</i>, particularly the famous statue of <i>Apollo</i> in
    the <i>Vatican</i> garden at <i>Rome</i>, made from the emperor‚Äôs
    face. Therefore we may well admit of it for the heroical effigies of
    <i>Phut</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Bochart</i> thinks, he fixt his habitation first at <i>Delos</i>,
    and his family, and thence the fable of his being born there. I have
    an ancient brass coin, with the heroical effigies of his mother
    <i>Latona</i>. Her head in the adverse <span lang="el">ŒôŒïŒ°Œë œπŒ•ŒùŒöŒõŒïŒôŒ§Œüœπ</span>, reverse, the

  <p>In this island of <i>Delos</i> he had a most magnificent temple, built
    to him in after ages, when idolatry began. The noble remains of it are
    to be seen there still. For his great fame and exploits, posterity
    consecrated him, calling him the son of <i>Jupiter</i>, meaning
    <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>, or more properly of <i>Saturn</i>.</p>

  <p>But in no place was <i>Phut</i> more famous than in <i>Phocis</i>.
    He planted the country about the mountain <i>Parnassus</i>, where
    he built, as I apprehend, a great serpentine temple, like ours
    of <i>Abury</i>, at the bottom of that mountain, by the city of
    <i>Delphos</i>. This I gather from the <i>Greek</i> reports of the
    serpent <i>Python</i> of an immense bulk, bred of the slime left on
    the earth, by the general deluge, which <i>Apollo</i> here overcame;
    and instituted annual games call‚Äôd <i>Pythia</i>, plainly from his
    own name. These were the first and most ancient games we hear of in
    <i>Greece</i>.</p>

  <p>Change the places, <i>Abury</i> for <i>Parnassus</i>, and we have both
    the natural, as well as chronological history of the place; a vast
    temple in form of a serpent, made out of stones left on the surface of
    the earth after the deluge: not only so but the very name too. The name
    of <i>Parnassus</i> was originally <i>Larnassus</i>, says <i>Stephanus
    Byzantinus</i>. The letter L is not a radical in this word, as the
    learned <i>Dickenson</i> observes in <i>Delphi ph≈ìnic.</i> therefore
    the word is <i>Harnassus</i>, <i>Har</i> is a headland or promontory
    of a hill, and <i>nahas</i> a serpent, which is no other than our
    <i>Hakpen</i> of <i>Abury</i>. Whence we conclude, the snaky temple
    extended its huge length along the bottom of <i>Parnassus</i>, and
    laid its head upon a promontory of it, just as ours at <i>Abury</i>,
    on <i>Overton-hill</i>. Whence <i>Ovid</i> not merely poetically,
    describes it;</p>

  <p>This was the original patriarchal temple dedicated to the true
    God, where oracles were originally given by <i>Themis</i> says
    <i>Apollodorus</i> I. 4. Which name I take to be a corruption made
    in after times from the <i>Jewish Thummim</i>, for a divine and true
    oracle; which <i>Dickenson</i> asserts to have been at this place,
    page 104. in time turn‚Äôd into an idolatrous one. Many built one after
    another, as the former ones were sack‚Äôd and destroy‚Äôd.</p>

  <p>The report of the mountain having been call‚Äôd <i>Larnassus</i>, is
    another argument of the high antiquity of this first serpentine temple
    here built by <i>Phut</i>, and throws us up to the patriarchal church,
    and to the times immediately after the great deluge. <i>Stephanus</i>
    of <i>Byzantium</i> before quoted, says it: and the interpreter of
    <i>Apollonius</i>, and <i>Ovid</i> makes <i>Apollo</i>‚Äôs engagement
    with <i>Python</i> to be immediately after the flood. They pretend
    the name <i>Larnassus</i> comes from <i>Larnax</i>, the ark of
    <i>Deucalion</i> landing here, agreeable to the <i>Greek</i> method of
    drawing all antiquity to themselves.</p>

  <p>The central obeliscal stone in some of the circular works here, which
    was the <i>Kebla</i>, as in the southern temple of <i>Abury</i>,
    was afterward, in idolatrous times, worshipped at <i>Delphos</i>
    for the statue of <i>Apollo</i>, as <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>
    writes, <i>Strom.</i> I. ‚Äôtill art and <i>Grecian</i> delicacy
    improv‚Äôd and produc‚Äôd elegant images, like that aforemention‚Äôd of the
    <i>vatican</i>, and innumerable more, still remaining.</p>

  <p>In <i>Vaillant</i>‚Äôs colony coins vol. I. page 242. is an elegant coin
    struck at <i>C√¶sarea</i>, to the emperor <i>Antoninus Pius</i>. On the
    reverse, <i>Apollo</i> standing, leans on a <i>tripod</i>, holds in his
    right hand a snake extended. The learned author is at a loss to explain
    it, therefore I may be allowed to give my opinion, that it relates to
    our present subject.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

  <p>It was the method of the ancient planters of colonies, to begin their
    work with building temples, I mean our patriarchal temples, for there
    were then no other. And they instituted festival and religious games,
    which contributed very much to polish and civilize mankind, and make
    them have a due notion and practice of religion, without which it
    is impossible for any date to subsist. Of this <i>Strabo</i> writes
    very sensibly in IX. treating on this very place. The <i>P√¶anick</i>
    or <i>Pythian</i> are the most ancient games we have any account of.
    <i>Strabo</i> writes very largely concerning them.</p>

  <p>These great festivals were at the four solar ingresses into the
    cardinal signs, which were the times of publick sacrificing, as I
    suppose, from the creation of the world. The <i>Pythian</i> festival
    was celebrated on the sixth day of the <i>Athenian</i> month
    <i>Thargelion</i>, <i>Delphick Busius</i>. ‚ÄôTis between <i>April</i>
    and <i>May</i>.</p>

  <p>But we learn, from the scholiast of <i>Pindar</i>, <i>prolegom. ad
    Pythia</i>, that <i>Apollo</i> instituted the <i>Pythia</i> on the
    seventh day after he had overcome the serpent <i>Python</i>; and that
    at <i>Delphos</i> they sung a hymn called <i>P√¶an</i> to <i>Apollo</i>
    every seventh day. The <i>Athenians</i> did the like, every seventh day
    of the moon, whence <i>Hesiod</i>‚Äôs</p>

  <p class="noindent">Because, says he, <i>Apollo</i> was born on that day.</p>

  <p>The learned <i>Gale</i> observes from this, in his court of the
    <i>Gentiles</i>, p. 150. that it means the sabbath as the patriarchal
    custom, before the <i>Jewish</i> institution. <i>Usher</i> before him,
    of the same opinion, in his discourse on the sabbath. <i>Porphyry</i>
    in his book concerning the <i>Jews</i>, quoted by <i>Eusebius pr.
    ev.</i> I. 9. tells us, the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> consecrated one day in
    seven as holy; he says indeed, it was in honour of their principal
    deity <i>Saturn</i>, as they call‚Äôd him, and <i>Israel</i>. We are not
    to regard his reason, any more than <i>Hesiod</i>‚Äôs aforementioned, but
    his testimony of a matter of fact, has its just weight. He means to
    prove a custom older than <i>Judaism</i>.</p>

  <p>I take all this to be an illustrious proof of the patriarchal
    observation of the sabbath, before the <i>Mosaick</i> dispensation.
    Their sabbath was intirely like our Christian, the greatest festival
    of all, and deservedly the most to be regarded, as being religion
    properly, or practical religion.</p>

  <p>We cannot easily determine on what day the patriarchal sabbath was
    kept, <i>Hesiod</i>‚Äôs reason being the birth day of <i>Apollo</i>,
    pleads for Sunday; <i>Porphyry</i>‚Äôs for saturday, consequent to which
    thus <i>Martial</i> XII. 63.</p>

    was a statue of <i>Apollo</i> carrying the <i>Docim√¶</i> or tithe,

  <p>To conclude this chapter, this labour of <i>Phut</i>‚Äôs is told in many
    places. Some say it was in <i>Mysia</i>, in <i>Phrygia</i> others,
    again in <i>Cilicia</i>, in <i>Pithecusa</i>, in <i>B≈ìotia</i>;
    <i>Strabo</i> xiii. writes, that it was in <i>Syria</i>; and there
    seems to have been a serpentine temple on the river <i>Orontes</i>
    of <i>Antioch</i>, for it was call‚Äôd originally <i>Typhon</i> and
    <span lang="el">ŒüœÜŒπœÑŒ∑œÇ</span>, as <i>Strabo</i> writes, xvi. and <i>Eustathius</i> in
    <i>Iliad</i>, p. 262. <i>Basil.</i> and in <i>Dionysium</i>. The story
    is of <i>Typhon</i> a huge serpent slain there by a thunderbolt from
    <i>Jupiter</i>, near a sacred cave called <i>Nymph√¶um</i>.</p>

  <p>The meaning of all this, seems to be, that <i>Phut</i> in person,
    or his people built them in all these places. <i>√Ü√¶as</i> a son of
    <i>Phut</i>‚Äôs, built the serpentine temple at <i>Colchis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Perseus</i> was a son of <i>Demaroon</i>, born in <i>Egypt</i>,
    <i>Euseb. p. e.</i> II. 1. he was co√¶val with <i>Phut</i>, and
    bore in his shield the sacred hierogram, and he probably built of
    these <i>Dracontia</i>. From this the poets made their fable of
    <i>Medusa</i>‚Äôs head, and that it turn‚Äôd men into snakes. <i>Hesiod</i>
    in the description of <i>Hercules</i>‚Äôs shield, thus paints him in
    <i>English</i>.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúAs he went, his adamantine shield sounded, and tinkled with a loud
    noise. In a circle two dragons were suspended, lifting up their
    heads.‚Äù <i>Johannes Malala</i> makes <i>Perseus</i> institutor of the
    <i>Magi</i>, who were the patriarchal priests of the east. He calls the
    river of <i>Antioch</i> abovementioned <i>Dracon</i>.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">NOT</span> much later in time than <i>Phut</i>, lived that other celebrated
    hero of antiquity, the <i>Egyptian</i>, <i>Ph≈ìnician</i>, <i>Tyrian
    Hercules</i>; whom I take to be a principal planter of <i>Britain</i>.
    He was of <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> extract, born in <i>Egypt</i> and king
    there, founder of <i>Tyre</i>, and the most famous navigator: the first
    that pass‚Äôd thro‚Äô the <i>Mediterranean</i>, and ventur‚Äôd into the great
    <i>Ocean</i>. I have wrote his history copiously, from which I must
    recite some deductions only, useful to our present purpose.</p>

  <p><i>Hercules</i> call‚Äôd <i>Melcartus</i>, was son of <i>Demaroon</i>,
    as <i>Sanchoniathon</i> the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> writer informs us.
    <i>Demaroon</i> was intituled <i>Zeus</i>, whence the <i>Greeks</i>
    made <i>Hercules</i> the son of <i>Jupiter</i>. <i>Demaroon</i>
    according to our <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> author, was son of <i>Dagon</i> or
    <i>Siton</i> son of <i>Ouranus</i> (who in truth is <i>Noah</i>) and
    begat after the flood, but it was not his business to mention the
    flood. <i>Hercules</i> then may reasonably be suppos‚Äôd to live to the
    same age as <i>Noah</i>‚Äôs other great grandsons; if we say grandsons,
    it alters not the case. We need not be concerned at the seeming great
    distance between <i>Hercules</i> in the genealogy and <i>Apher</i>:
    for from <i>Sanchoniathon</i> we may prove that <i>Melchisedec</i> was
    <i>Arphaxad</i>. He conversed with <i>Abraham</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Josephus</i> in his first book against <i>Apion</i> has preserv‚Äôd
    a valuable and venerable piece of antiquity, call‚Äôd <i>Manethon</i>,
    the <i>Egyptians‚Äô Dynasties</i>. This has given the learned much
    entertainment. I have considered it too with attention, in what I have
    wrote concerning the <i>Mosaick</i> chronology. I shall here recite
    some conclusions from it, for my present purpose.</p>

  <p>The dynasty of the pastor kings is what we are chiefly concern‚Äôd
    in, which belongs to the most early ages after the flood. Sir
    <i>John Marsham</i> has set them too low. Bishop <i>Usher</i> and
    <i>Cumberland</i> are much nearer the truth, as I apprehend, and from
    whom I differ very little. The last of this dynasty of pastors is
    <i>Assis</i>, <i>Archles</i>, our <i>Egyptian Hercules</i>. They were
    <i>Canaanites</i> that followed <i>Misraim</i> into <i>Egypt</i>, and
    at first liv‚Äôd very peaceably, but in time the two families quarrel‚Äôd,
    and wag‚Äôd terrible wars together, for 200 years. The <i>Misraimites</i>
    possess‚Äôd the upper regions of the <i>Nile</i>, <i>Canaanites</i>
    the lower or marshy part upon the <i>Mediterranean</i> sea, call‚Äôd
    <i>Delta</i>. Hence the former call‚Äôd ‚Äôem <i>Titans</i>, i. e. dirty,
    fenmen, bog-trotters, as we say contemptuously, of a people who are
    their real descendants. The <i>Misraimites</i> call‚Äôd themselves the
    <i>Elohim</i>, or Gods, descendants of <i>Ilus</i> or <i>Cham</i>,
    and that liv‚Äôd, as it were, in a heavenly region, toward <i>Egyptian
    Ethiopia</i>, where <i>Homer</i> makes the gods to hold their
    festivals. So the <i>Greeks</i> call‚Äôd such as liv‚Äôd in the high
    countries, <i>Athamanes</i>, <i>heavenly</i>. Mount <i>Olympus</i> was
    heaven, the habitation of the gods. This was the way of talking in the
    heroical times.</p>

  <p>The <i>Canaanites</i>, on the other hand, call‚Äôd themselves
    <i>Hycsi</i>, or <i>royal pastors</i>. And the stories of the battles
    between these two people are the oldest stories we have among the
    poets, when they ring about the wars between the gods and the
    <i>Titans</i>.</p>

  <p>In the chronology of this pastor dynasty, I differ a little from the
    great authors aforementioned. The chief reason why, is this. They take
    the numbers in <i>Josephus</i>‚Äôs catalogue, as in the present copies;
    but I hold ‚Äôem erroneous, and to be corrected from <i>Africanus</i>,
    <i>Eusebius</i>, and <i>Syncellus</i>, who copied from <i>Josephus</i>
    in earlier times. <i>Josephus</i>‚Äôs present numbers are somewhat too
    short: for tho‚Äô <i>Africanus</i>, <i>Eusebius</i>, and <i>Syncellus</i>
    differ from one another, as well as from <i>Josephus</i>, (such is
    the misfortune of negligence in transcription) yet they all agree
    to heighten the numbers. And <i>Josephus</i> himself, twice in the
    same books, makes the sum total to be 393 years, which is more
    than his particulars, by which <i>Marsham</i>, <i>Usher</i>, and
    <i>Cumberland</i> go. But take that sum total 393, and set it at the
    <i>exodus</i>, and count upwards: I apprehend then we have it in its
    right situation.</p>

  <p>By this means, the head of the pastor dynasty in <i>Egypt</i>, which
    commenced with <i>Salatis</i>, must be placed <i>anno mundi</i> 1860
    instead of 1920, as <i>Usher</i> and <i>Cumberland</i> have it: and
    during the reign of <i>Menes</i>, <i>Misraim</i>, <i>Osiris</i>,
    according to their own chronology. This, I am confident, is near the
    truth. And thus that dynasty is to be plac‚Äôd in the list of time.</p>

  <p class="noindent">By this means we have an opening scene of the greatest matters of
    antiquity, that relate to the world in general, as well as particularly
    to the island of <i>Great Britain</i>; of which I must give some
    account.</p>

  <p>In the year of the world 2083, the great patriarch <i>Abraham</i>
    came out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> of <i>Chaldea</i> into the land of <i>Canaan</i>. This
    is in the 13th year of the reign of our <i>Melcarthus</i> in lower
    <i>Egypt</i>. About 2087, not 2084 (as <i>Usher</i> sets it)
    <i>Abraham</i>, by famine constrained, goes down to <i>Egypt</i>,
    that is, into lower <i>Egypt</i>. So that our <i>Melcarthus</i> is
    the real <i>Pharaoh</i> mention‚Äôd <i>Gen</i>. xii. who would have
    taken <i>Sarah</i>, <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs wife, ‚Äôtill he learn‚Äôd the truth.
    <i>Usher</i>, at the year 2084, calls him <i>Apophis</i>; but ‚Äôtis an
    error of the pen, it means <i>Janias</i>, predecessor to <i>Assis</i>,
    whom he sets as regent from <i>anno mundi</i> 2081. <i>Castor</i> the
    chronographer, in <i>Syncellus</i>, writes, ‚Äúthat <i>Abraham</i> was
    well learn‚Äôd in the knowledge of astronomy, and the other sciences of
    the <i>Chaldeans</i>.‚Äù <i>Berosus</i>, author of the <i>Chaldean</i>
    history, gave him the character of ‚Äúa just and great man, expert in
    astronomy.‚Äù <i>Josephus</i> adds, ‚Äúthat <i>Hecateus</i> had such a
    value for his memory, that he wrote his history.‚Äù <i>Nicholas</i> of
    <i>Damascus</i> an historian, and <i>Trogus</i>, make him a king.
    <i>Alexander Polyhistor</i> relates from <i>Eupolomus</i>, ‚Äúthat
    <i>Abraham</i> exceeded all men in wisdom; that astronomy was founded
    by him among the <i>Chaldeans</i>; that he came into <i>Ph≈ìnicia</i>,
    and taught the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> astronomy; that he being constrain‚Äôd
    by famine, went into <i>Egypt</i>, lived in <i>Eliopolis</i> among the
    priests, and taught them astronomy; yet he did not pretend to be the
    inventor of the art, but had it deliver‚Äôd to him by succession from
    <i>Enoch</i>.‚Äù <i>Artapanus</i> likewise, the historian, mention‚Äôd by
    <i>Eusebius pr√¶p. evang.</i> IX. 4. he speaks of ‚Äú<i>Abraham</i> going
    to the king of <i>Egypt</i>, and teaching him astronomy, and that after
    twenty years he return‚Äôd into <i>Syria</i>.‚Äù <i>Melo</i>, another old
    heathen author, speaks much of <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs wisdom. These writers,
    as wholly disinterested, sufficiently shew that <i>Egypt</i> hence
    learn‚Äôd astronomy, and <i>Melcarthus</i> their king in particular.</p>

  <p>It seems, at this time, the major part of the world, thro‚Äô ignorance
    or negligence, knew not the true length of a year, making it of 360
    days only. But <i>Abraham</i> taught the <i>Egyptians</i> better; for
    now we may understand that remark in <i>Syncellus</i>, that under
    <i>Assis</i> or <i>Hercules</i>, the last of the pastor kings, the 5
    additional days were placed in their year. And then a solar year of 365
    days first began among the <i>Egyptians</i>. ‚ÄôTis somewhat odd, that
    the <i>Egyptians</i> should call these 5 additional days by the word
    <i>Nesi</i>, which signifies a <i>snake</i>. I suppose they meant by
    it <i>sacred days</i>, <i>holy days</i>. They were placed at the end
    of the year, and reckon‚Äôd birth-days of the gods, I suppose from some
    fore-notices they had of the birth of Messiah at that time of the year;
    for I find all antiquity had such notice. But <i>Syncellus</i> does
    not tell us the whole of the truth: <i>Abraham</i> taught <i>Assis</i>
    likewise the intercalation of the quarter-day, and the leap-day every
    fourth year. For, according to what I have been able to see concerning
    this matter, the <i>Mosaic</i> or patriarchal year was solar, and
    strictly <i>Julian</i>. But when the world was o‚Äôerwhelm‚Äôd with
    idolatry, providence judg‚Äôd proper to alter the year too, in order to
    dislocate their heathenish and superstitious festivals. Therefore to
    <i>Moses</i> God communicated the form of the lun√¶-solar year, which
    the <i>Jews</i> use to this day. But toward the advent of Messiah,
    providence took care to restore the ancient patriarchal year, in the
    <i>Julian</i> form.</p>

  <p>Hence we may account for what <i>Herodotus</i> tells us of the
    <i>Thebans</i>, a people in upper <i>Egypt</i>, who intercalate the
    quarter-day every fourth year: from the earliest times, no doubt from
    the time of <i>Hercules</i>.</p>

  <p>Let us mention this remark. In the sacred account of <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs
    sojourning here in <i>Egypt</i>, we meet with no distaste of the
    <i>Egyptians</i> to shepherds, which in his grandson <i>Jacob</i>‚Äôs
    time was an abomination to them. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>This shews that the pastor kings
    now reign‚Äôd here, with whom <i>Abraham</i> convers‚Äôd; and it shews the
    reason of that abomination, when they were expell‚Äôd; it confirms this
    history of <i>Manethon</i>‚Äôs dynasty, and illustrates the scriptures.
    <i>Jacob</i>‚Äôs family being <i>Canaanites</i> and shepherds, were taken
    to be of those that held the <i>Egyptians</i> in so long a war. They
    were pretended to be spies by <i>Joseph</i>, <i>Gen.</i> xlii. 9.</p>

  <p>Further, we have another very important piece of history from
    <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs being in <i>Egypt</i>, which the learned are not aware
    of; for hence ‚Äôtis more than presumption, that the <i>Egyptians</i>
    learn‚Äôd the use of letters or alphabet-writing. If we seek into the
    accounts transmitted to us by <i>letters</i>, concerning their own
    origin, <i>Philo</i> the <i>Jew</i> expressly attributes the invention
    thereof to <i>Abraham</i>. Whence <i>Plato in Philebo</i> and <i>in
    Ph√¶dro</i>, contends for their first appearance in <i>Egypt</i>,
    discover‚Äôd by <i>Theut</i>, ‚Äúwho, whether he be a god, or a man,
    is doubtful,‚Äù says he; meaning, the use of them must be a divine
    communication. <i>Syncellus</i> writes, ‚Äúthe opinion of some is, that
    <i>Abraham</i> brought letters out of <i>Chaldea</i>, and taught them
    to the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>, and they taught them to the <i>Greeks</i>.‚Äù
    <i>Diodorus</i> V. writes, ‚Äúthe <i>Syrians</i> invented letters, and
    the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> learn‚Äôd the great secret from them.‚Äù <i>Eusebius,
    pr. ev.</i> X. confirms this, but asserts, ‚Äúthat by the <i>Syrians</i>
    are meant the <i>Assyrians</i> (as was often the case in old accounts)
    or the <i>Hebrews</i> more particularly.‚Äù It was, in truth, the
    ancestors of <i>Abraham</i>. And this I believe is the real truth. God
    first imparted this knowledge to the patriarchal family, for preserving
    the sacred records of his church; and <i>Abraham</i> now taught their
    use to <i>Assis</i>, the <i>Hercules</i>, son of <i>Nilus Jupiter</i>,
    who wrote in the <i>Phrygian</i> letters, says <i>Cicero</i>.</p>

  <p>All this is exceedingly confirm‚Äôd by the explication which Mr.
    <i>Toland</i> gives us concerning <i>Hercules Ogmius</i>, in his
    history of the Druids. <i>Lucian</i> says, ‚Äôtis a word of their own
    language, by which the <i>Celts</i> call <i>Hercules</i>. And the
    word has hitherto been inexplicable. He relates the picture of him
    (in <i>Hercule Gallico</i>) which he saw in <i>Gaul</i>, which was
    explain‚Äôd to him by a Druid. He was pictured as clad with a lion‚Äôs
    skin, a club in his right hand, a bent bow in his left, a quiver
    hanging o‚Äôer his shoulders. As for his form, he was an old man, bald
    before, wrinkled, and in colour like a sun-burnt sailor. A multitude
    of people were represented as drawn after him by golden chains from
    their ears, center‚Äôd in his tongue. The Druid told <i>Lucian</i>, that
    <i>Ogmius</i> accomplish‚Äôd his great atchievements by his eloquence,
    and reduc‚Äôd the people of this western world, from rude and barbarous
    to a state of civility.</p>

  <p>A memorial of this knowledge which <i>Hercules</i> had of letters, we
    find in <i>Heph√¶stion</i> V. where he writes, ‚Äú<i>Hercules</i> gave
    the name of <i>Alpha</i> to the first letter, in honour to the river
    <i>Alpheus</i>, when victor at the <i>olympic</i> games.‚Äù My late
    learned friend, Mr. <i>Keysler</i>, in his <i>Antiq. septentrional.</i>
    guessed well that <i>Ogmius</i> means <i>literatus</i>, a <i>man
    of letters</i>, as we commonly say; more properly spoken of
    <i>Hercules</i> than of others. But Mr. <i>Toland</i> shews evidently,
    that <i>Ogum</i> is a word in the <i>Irish</i> language, importing
    the secret of alphabet writing; the <i>literarum secreta</i>, as
    <i>Tacitus</i> calls it, <i>de mor. germ.</i> So that <i>Hercules
    Ogmius</i> fully imports the learned <i>Hercules</i>, and especially
    one that was master of alphabet writing; without which learning is
    but a vague and uncertain thing. This our <i>Hercules</i> learn‚Äôd
    of <i>Abraham</i> in the east, and this he brought with our Druids
    into the extremest west, in this very early age of the world, as we
    have all the reason imaginable to believe. That they had letters, we
    have <i>C√¶sar</i>‚Äôs express testimony,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
    and they were the same as the
    <i>greek</i> letters, because the very same. They had them from the
    same fountain as the <i>Grecians</i>, tho‚Äô somewhat earlier; for I take
    our <i>Hercules</i> to be a little prior in time to <i>Cadmus</i>, who
    carry‚Äôd letters into Greece.</p>

  <p><i>Hercules</i> therefore was learned and eloquent, a great
    astronomer, and philosopher. A fragment of <i>Pal√¶phatus</i> in
    the <i>Alexandrian</i> chronicle, calls him the <i>Tyrian</i>
    philosopher, who found out the purple dye: <i>Suidas</i> in the word
    <i>Hercules</i>, the like. And long before, <i>Heraclitus in Allegoriis
    Homericis</i>, says, he was a wise man, a great philosopher, <span lang="el">Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÉŒøœÜŒπŒ±œÇ
    ŒøœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩŒπŒøœÖ ŒúœÖœÉœÑŒ∑œÇ</span>, one initiated into the wisdom from above; we may call
    him a professor of divinity.</p>

  <p>Thus he appears a worthy scholar of the great <i>Abraham</i>, and
    from him the Druids learn‚Äôd the groundwork of learning, religion, and
    philosophy, which they were so famous for ever after. But my purpose is
    to be very short on this head at present: nevertheless I must remark
    that our <i>Assis</i> was not only acquainted with <i>Abraham</i>
    in <i>Egypt</i>, but likewise in the land of <i>Canaan</i> or
    <i>Ph≈ìnicia</i>; for he quitted <i>Egypt</i> by compact with
    <i>Tethmosis</i> <i>A.M.</i> 2120, carrying away with him 240000 men, which
    enabled him to transport colonies all over the <i>Mediterranean</i> and
    the ocean. And he must dwell several years in <i>Canaan</i> before his
    projects of that kind were ripe. But <i>Abraham</i> dy‚Äôd <i>A.M.</i>
    2183, so that there was abundantly time enough for the two great men
    to renew their acquaintance, and there is much reason to think they
    actually did so.</p>

  <p>Therefore as it was the patriarchal custom to raise temples wherever
    they came; so of our hero <i>Hercules</i>, whether thro‚Äô his own pious
    disposition,or in imitation of <i>Abraham</i>: we hear of his raising
    pillars too, which means our temples. And thence he obtain‚Äôd the name
    in antiquity, of <i>Hercules Saxanus</i>.</p>

  <p>Thus the learned <i>Lud. Vives</i> on St. <i>Augustin C. D.</i>
    viii. 9. ‚ÄúThe philosophy of the <i>Egyptians</i> is very ancient,
    but for the most part deriv‚Äôd from the <i>Chaldeans</i>, especially
    from <i>Abraham</i>, tho‚Äô they, as <i>Diodorus</i> writes, refer
    it to <i>Isis</i>, <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Vulcan</i>, <i>Mercury</i>,
    and <i>Hercules</i>.‚Äù Further from <i>Joseph</i>‚Äôs administration,
    the <i>Egyptian</i> learning commenc‚Äôd, for which they became so
    celebrated. He not only instructed the priests in religion and
    philosophy, but settled their colleges and possessions, as we read in
    <i>Gen.</i> xlvii. 22, 26. so that if <i>Moses</i> was learned in the
    wisdom of the <i>Egyptians</i>, he deriv‚Äôd it only thro‚Äô them from his
    own ancestors. Which note may be useful to give us a true notion of
    this matter, which some learned men exalt too high. And this at the
    same time shews idolatry commenc‚Äôd in <i>Egypt</i>, after his time.
    They consecrated <i>Joseph</i> into the genius or intelligence of their
    first monarch <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Serapis</i>, &amp;c. with the bushel on his
    head. But what I chiefly insist upon at present, is of <i>Hercules</i>
    making these serpentine temples, which in his history is call‚Äôd
    overcoming serpents and the like. And hence the fable of his squeezing
    two serpents to death in his cradle; and the <i>Tyrian</i> coins struck
    to his honour, some whereof I have exhibited.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of his building our Druid temples in general, of these great stones,
    the two coins of <i>Gordian</i> in <i>Stonehenge</i> page 50, are a
    further evidence. The <i>Ambrosi√¶ Petr√¶</i> are a work of this sort,
    when he began or assisted in building the city <i>Tyre</i>. And I
    gather he was a great builder of serpentine temples in particular, such
    as we have been describing, call‚Äôd <i>Dracontia</i>. What he did of
    this sort in <i>Britain</i> I have no foundation for discovering; but
    in ancient history still left us, there are sufficient traces that shew
    he did it, in the more eastern parts of the world.</p>

  <p>For instance, at <i>Acon</i> or <i>Ptolemais</i> as call‚Äôd afterward,
    a city on the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> shore: it regain‚Äôd its first name and
    now is call‚Äôd St. <i>John</i> of <i>Acres</i>, from a famous church
    there. The first city was probably built by our <i>Hercules</i>,
    at least he made one of these temples there, as I gather from
    the name of the place, coins and reports relating thereto. The
    <i>Greeks</i> call it <span lang="el">ŒëŒ∫Œ∑</span>, and according to their custom, give it a
    <i>Greek</i> original, from <span lang="el">Œ±Œ∫ŒµŒπœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ</span>, because says the <i>Etymologicum
    magnum</i>, <i>Hercules</i> was there <i>heal‚Äôd</i> of the bite of
    a serpent. <i>Stephanus</i> of <i>Byzance</i> the same, in the word
    <i>Ptolemais</i>; in the word <i>Ake</i>, he says, that <i>Claudius
    Julius</i> in his vol. I. of the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> history, writes,
    ‚Äúthat it had its name from <i>Hercules</i>, who was order‚Äôd by the
    oracle to go eastward, ‚Äôtill he came to a river, and found the herb
    <i>Colocasia</i>, which would cure his wound. He came to the river
    <i>Belus</i>, which here runs into the sea, and there found the herb.‚Äù
    <i>Salmasius</i> in his <i>Plinian</i> exercitations, affirms, the herb
    is <i>Dracunculus</i>; it grows in our gardens, called <i>Dragons</i>,
    from its likeness to a snake‚Äôs head and tongue; and being spotted like
    a snake.</p>

  <p>All this I can understand no otherwise, than that <i>Hercules</i>
    made a serpentine temple on the side of this river, where the city
    <i>Acon</i> was afterward built, and which took its name from this
    temple, as our <i>Hakpen</i> at <i>Abury</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> for <span lang="he">◊¢◊õ◊ü</span> <i>Acan</i>
    in the <i>Chaldee</i>, signifies a serpent, as we observed before.
    <i>Josephus</i> informs us, by the river <i>Belus</i> was the sepulchre
    of <i>Memnon</i>; which probably was made here in regard to the temple.</p>

  <p>When we come into <i>Greece</i>, we hear of <i>Hercules</i> overcoming
    the <i>Lernean</i> snake, which <i>Heraclides Ponticus</i> writes had
    50 heads. We may very well understand this of 50 stones, which compos‚Äôd
    the head, as our temple on <i>Overton-hill</i> of 58. <i>Heph√¶stion</i>
    II. recites from <i>Alexander</i> the <i>Myndian</i>, that this
    <i>Hydra</i> was turn‚Äôd into stone. Thus hints and reports are
    drop‚Äôd, which preserve the real truth invelop‚Äôd in fable; as was the
    <i>Greek</i> method in all matters of antiquity.</p>

  <p>This snake was of a very unusual bulk, and lay near a great water,
    call‚Äôd the <i>Lernean</i>-lake, by a large plane-tree, and the spring
    <i>Anymone</i>. Further ‚Äôtis said, in overcoming this animal (by which
    they mean the labour he bestow‚Äôd in accomplishing the work) he us‚Äôd the
    help of <i>Iolaus</i> the waggoner. Such help must be highly useful to
    him, to bring the stones. But I observe from the name <i>Iolaus</i>
    his waggoner and companion, and <i>Hylas</i> another great friend of
    his, and <i>Iole</i> his mistress, that the ancient druidical festival
    is couch‚Äôd under that name, call‚Äôd <i>Yule</i>, which I shall speak
    largely upon in its proper place. In the mean time (we are told) the
    snake was assisted against him, by a very great crab. This will appear
    strange, ‚Äôtill we are directed to its meaning by this consideration.
    As the serpent means the <i>Dracontian</i> temple, so the crab was a
    symbol like in figure and meaning to the <i>globus alatus</i> or winged
    circle, which was the ancient picture of the <i>anima mundi</i>, or
    divine spirit. Thus does mythology, when rightly consider‚Äôd, help us in
    these ancient enquiries. We may say of the work as <i>Statius</i> does
    of the temple of <i>Hercules Surrentinus</i>,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There are like vestiges of other <i>Dracontian</i> temples founded by
    <i>Hercules</i> in <i>Spain</i>, <i>Africa</i>, and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>‚Äú<i>Hercules</i>,‚Äù says bishop <i>Cumberland</i>, ‚Äúwas a very learned
    prince, bred or conversant in the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> universities,
    whereof <i>Debir</i> was one, <i>Josh.</i> xv. 15. 49. call‚Äôd for
    its eminence, <i>Kirjath-sepher</i>, the <i>city of books</i>; and
    <i>Kirjath-sanna</i>, the <i>city of learning</i>.‚Äù The bishop thinks
    he retreated from <i>Egypt</i> about the time of <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs
    death. But, from what chronological evidence I gave before, it must be
    a good while before it. And I do not doubt but he with pleasure renew‚Äôd
    his acquaintance with his old friend <i>Abraham</i>, in the land of <i>Canaan</i>.</p>

  <p>There seems to be a very pregnant proof of this, in that
    <i>Hercules</i> had a son call‚Äôd <i>Isaac</i>, to whom one would
    imagine <i>Abraham</i> was sponsor at his baptism, or perhaps his son
    <i>Isaac</i>; for baptism was one part of the patriarchal religion.
    And they had susceptors, sponsors, or what we call <i>god-fathers</i>
    at the font, as we have. Of this <i>Isaac</i> son of <i>Hercules</i>,
    <i>Plutarch</i> informs us, <i>de Isid. &amp; Osir.</i> remembred by the
    <i>Phrygians</i>, for he was planted in <i>Phrygia</i> by his father
    <i>Hercules</i>. Hence it became a common name there, and <i>√Üsacus</i>
    son of king <i>Priam</i> is but the same name, as my learned friend
    Mr. <i>Baxter</i> thinks, in his <i>glossar. Antiq. Rom.</i> If this
    consideration be joined to what I wrote in <i>Stonehenge</i> about
    <i>Phryxus</i>, or <i>Apher</i>, grandson of <i>Abraham</i>, having
    a concern in planting, and even naming of <i>Britain</i>, it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>may
    afford us another hint about our <i>Phrygian</i> extract, which the old
    <i>Britons</i> are so fond of. And we can expect no other than these
    kind of hints, in matters of such extreme antiquity. And further, as he
    was concern‚Äôd in settling colonies in <i>Spain</i>, we may attribute to
    him the claim which the <i>Gall√¶ci</i> there had, to a <i>Trojan</i>
    descent, of which <i>Justin</i> informs us.</p>

  <p>This <i>Apher</i> is the <i>Africus</i> mention‚Äôd by <i>Mela</i>,
    I. 9. He calls him an <i>Arabian</i> king, who being driven out by
    the <i>Assyrians</i>, went into <i>Africa</i>. ‚ÄôTis very remarkable,
    that his name, when interpreted, signifies <i>Tyn</i>; as the great
    <i>Bochart</i> makes the name of <i>Britain</i>, come from <i>Bratanac,
    the land of tyn</i>; equivalent to the <i>greek</i> word <span lang="el">Œ∫Œ±œÉœÉŒπœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ</span>,
    whence <i>Cassiterides</i> in <i>latin</i>. This expulsion seems to be
    hinted at in <i>Gen.</i> xiv. 6. in the days of <i>Abraham</i>. Now
    a reader not much acquainted with these kind of inquiries, will be
    apt to smile at pretending to a similitude between <i>Apher</i> and
    <i>Britain</i>. So in making the <i>Wiltshire</i> word <i>sarsens</i>
    deriv‚Äôd from the same word as the name of the city of <i>Tyre</i>; tho‚Äô
    ‚Äôtis an undeniable fact, and easily perceiv‚Äôd by the learned.</p>

  <p>The evidences of <i>Hercules</i> planting <i>Britain</i>, are
    of the like nature, which I shall very briefly recapitulate.
    <i>Apollodorus</i> in II. after the story of <i>Hercules</i>,
    <i>Ant√¶us</i> and <i>Geryon</i>, two kings in <i>Afric</i>
    and <i>Spain</i>, mentions his conquering <i>Alebion</i> and
    <i>Dercynus</i> sons of <i>Neptune</i>, in the same mythologic strain
    as the others, because they attempted to drive away his oxen. He makes
    it to be in <i>Libya</i>, others in <i>Ligya</i> or <i>Liguria</i>,
    others in <i>Gaul</i>. The variety of places is of no consequence
    in these very old stories. I regard only the personal names of
    <i>Albion</i> and <i>Bergion</i>, as more commonly call‚Äôd, sons of
    <i>Neptune</i>. If this be really so, sons of <i>Tarshish</i>, son
    of <i>Javan</i>: for <i>Tarshish</i> was the true <i>Neptune</i> of
    the heathen; and he was one of the sons to whom the heathen generally
    attribute the plantation of islands, as well as <i>Moses</i>,
    <i>Gen.</i> x. 5. But <i>Albion</i> and <i>Bergion</i> are notoriously
    most ancient names of <i>Britain</i> and <i>Ireland</i>. <i>Mela</i>,
    II. 5. mentions <i>Hercules</i> fighting <i>Albion</i> and
    <i>Bergion</i>. So <i>Tzetzes in chiliad.</i> and <i>Tzetzes</i> the
    interpreter of <i>Lycophron</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Tacitus</i> says expressly <i>Hercules</i> was in <i>Germany</i>, in
    that part lying upon the ocean especially. <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i>,
    in his XV. 9. tells us from <i>Timagenes</i>, an ancient historian,
    ‚Äúthat the <i>Dorienses</i> following the more ancient <i>Hercules</i>,
    inhabited the western countries bordering on the ocean.‚Äù By mount
    <i>Carmel</i> was a city <i>Dora</i> spoken of by <i>Josephus</i>, and
    by <i>Stephanus</i> of <i>Byzantium</i>, quoting <i>Hecat√¶us</i>, and
    many more old authors. See the famous fragment of <i>Stephanus</i>.
    <i>Claudius Julius</i>, in his III. of the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> history,
    writes, ‚Äúnext to <i>C√¶sarea</i> is <i>Dora</i>, inhabited by
    <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> on account of the great quantity of the purple fish
    there found.‚Äù Now <i>Hercules</i> being confessedly the inventor of
    this <i>Tyrian</i> dye, ‚Äôtis probable the companions of his, mention‚Äôd
    by <i>Ammianus</i>, were of this city.</p>

  <p>If <i>Hercules</i> peopled the ocean, coasts of <i>Gaul</i>,
    <i>Spain</i> and <i>Germany</i>, we may well imagine he would do
    the like in <i>Britain</i>. <i>Pliny</i>‚Äôs testimony is express,
    that <i>Melcarthus</i> (corruptly <i>Midacritus</i>) first brought
    <i>tyn</i> from the <i>Cassiterid</i> islands, which can be no other
    than <i>Britain</i>.</p>

  <p>The poets and mythologists, when speaking of the <i>Titans</i>, agree
    they went all into the west, which seems to be meant of <i>Hercules</i>
    and his people settling in <i>Britain</i>. Our <i>Thule</i>, or
    northern island, seems to have been named by our <i>Hercules</i>, as a
    demonstration of his being there, from an island of the same name in
    the <i>Persian</i> gulph. Of which <i>Bochart</i>.</p>

  <p>The like is to be inferr‚Äôd from such stories as that related by
    <i>Parthenius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> Nic√¶us</i>, ‚Äúthat <i>Hercules</i> travelling, after
    his expedition against <i>Geryon</i>, pass‚Äôd thro‚Äô the country of the
    <i>Celts</i>, and was entertain‚Äôd by <i>Britannus</i>. His daughter
    <i>Celtine</i> fell in love with him, on whom he begat a son call‚Äôd
    <i>Celtus</i>; from him afterwards the people of the <i>Celts</i>
    received their denomination.‚Äù</p>

  <p>We took notice before, that these shepherds who quitted <i>Egypt</i>
    under the conduct of our <i>Hercules</i>, call‚Äôd themselves
    <i>Hycsi</i>, as <i>Manethon</i> informs us in <i>Josephus &amp;
    Eusebius in chronol.</i> The word imports <i>royal shepherds</i>,
    <i>valiant</i>, <i>freemen</i>, <i>heroes</i>. Now we find the
    remains of this very name in the south-western part of our island,
    in <i>Worcestershire</i>, even to the <i>Roman</i> times, and still
    further, even to the time of venerable <i>Bede</i>. They were called
    <i>Huiccii</i>, to which <i>Orduices</i> and <i>Vigornienses</i>
    is synonymous. And all three words mean the same thing, as the
    great <i>Baxter</i> shews in his glossary, <i>Antiq. Britan. voce
    Orduices</i>, <i>Iceni</i>, <i>Huiccii</i>, &amp;c. And by all accounts our
    old <i>Britons</i> lov‚Äôd that same free, shepherd‚Äôs life, which the
    old <i>Canaanites</i> did about <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs time, as describ‚Äôd in
    scripture. Bishop <i>Cumberland</i> is elaborate upon it.</p>

  <p>I take the <i>Irish</i>, and ancient highland <i>Scots</i>, to be the
    remains of the original <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> colony. My learned friend, Dr.
    <i>Pocock</i>, when he was in <i>Ireland</i>, observ‚Äôd a surprizing
    conformity between the present <i>Irish</i> and the <i>Egyptians</i>,
    and that in very many instances.</p>

  <p>These considerations, added to what I said in <i>Stonehenge</i>, are
    enough to persuade us, that our <i>Hercules</i> had a considerable hand
    in peopling <i>Britain</i>.</p>

    <i>Part of</i> Cadmus <i>his history, who was a builder of
    serpentine temples. He was son of</i> Canaan <i>called</i>
    Agenor. <i>He was a</i> Horite <i>or</i> Hivite, <i>call‚Äôd</i>
    Kadmonite <i>in scripture.</i> Hivite <i>signifies a serpent.

    of the Lord of hosts,‚Äù read</i> merchant. <i>‚ÄôTis a prophecy
    not attended to</i>, Zech. xiv. 21. <i>The ancient</i> greek
    <i>fables of sowing serpents‚Äô teeth; of</i> Cadmus <i>and his
    wife being turn‚Äôd into serpents, and the like; are form‚Äôd from
    their building serpentine temples. Not to be wonder‚Äôd at so
    much, when our country-people have the very same reports of</i>
    Rouldrich <i>stones; of the</i> Weddings, <i>another Druid temple
    in</i> Somersetshire; <i>of</i> Long Meg and her daughters,
    <i>another in</i> Cumberland; <i>and most firmly believe, that
    they were men and women turn‚Äôd into stones. The mythology of the
    ancients not to be despis‚Äôd, but its original meaning sought
    for.</i>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">NONE</span> more famous in <i>Grecian</i> history than <i>Cadmus</i>, who
    brought them the use of those letters that convey‚Äôd their history to
    us, and preserv‚Äôd the little knowledge we can chiefly have of profane
    antiquity. He was son of <i>Agenor</i>, by which word the <i>Greeks</i>
    chose to pronounce the difficult one of <i>Canaan</i>. <i>Alexander
    Polyhistor</i> cites out of <i>Eupolemus</i>; ‚Äúfrom <i>Saturn</i> (who
    is <i>Cham</i>) came <i>Belus</i> and <i>Canaan</i>, and <i>Canaan</i>
    begat the father of the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>, or <i>Ph≈ìnix</i>.
    <i>Eusebius, pr. ev.</i> 9 has it too. Again, <i>Eusebius, pr. ev.</i>
    1. quotes from <i>Sanchoniathon</i>, <i>Cna</i>, (<i>Canaan</i>,)
    who was styled among the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> <span class="gespertt1">ŒßŒóŒùŒë</span>.‚Äù So in
    <i>Stephanas</i> of <i>Byzantium</i>, <i>Ph≈ìnicia</i> is called <span class="gespertt1">ŒßŒóŒùŒë</span>,
    and the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> <span class="gespertt1">ŒßŒóŒùŒëŒô</span>, which is <i>Canaanites</i>.
    <span class="gespertt1">ŒßŒóŒùŒë</span>,
    <i>Cna</i>, is <i>Agenor</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Cadmus</i> lived in the time of, or very little after
    <i>Hercules</i>. Tho‚Äô the <i>Parian</i> marble is an invaluable
    monument, yet ‚Äôtis not an infallible one. If the learned <i>Bentley</i>
    finds it erring about <i>Stesichorus</i>, we must not depend on its
    <i>√¶ra</i> of <i>Cadmus</i>, who lived a thousand years before that
    stone was made. Nor is the authority of <i>Eusebius</i>‚Äôs chronology
    in this particular, greater. <i>Bochart</i> holds him older than the
    builder of <i>Tyre</i>; <i>there</i> perhaps he heightens his date a
    little too much.</p>

  <p>To have a proper notion of the history of this great man, bishop
    <i>Cumberland</i> shews us, that the <i>Horites</i> or <i>Hivites</i>,
    sons of <i>Canaan</i>, i. e. the colony or people of <i>Cadmus</i>
    son of <i>Agenor</i>, or <i>Canaan</i>, went out of the land of
    <i>Canaan</i> about the same time that <i>Misraim</i> or <i>Osiris</i>,
    son of <i>Cham</i>, went to plant <i>Egypt</i>. They went likewise
    into <i>Egypt</i>. They lived quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> there for some time, but war
    arising between the <i>Misraimites</i> and the pastors, they retir‚Äôd
    back again, probably a little before the expulsion of the pastors.
    Some went to the north of <i>Canaan</i>, about mount <i>Hermon</i>
    under <i>Libanus</i>; some remain‚Äôd in the more southern parts, more
    particularly call‚Äôd <i>Horites</i>, or <i>Avim</i>, or <i>Hivites</i>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Gen.</i> xv. 18. when God made his great covenant with
    <i>Abraham</i>, he tells him, he will give him the land of the
    <i>Kenites</i>, and <i>Kenizzites</i>, and <i>Kadmonites</i>,
    and <i>Hittites</i>, and <i>Perizzites</i>, and <i>Rephaims</i>,
    <i>Amorites</i>, &amp;c. By <i>Kadmonites</i> he means the people of
    <i>Cadmus</i> son of <i>Canaan</i>. But afterward, in all those places
    where these nations are recited, they are called <i>Hivites</i>;
    <i>Cadmus</i> was likewise call‚Äôd <i>Hyas</i>, <i>Hiv√¶us</i>:
    <i>Hyas</i> or <i>Cadmus</i>, one or both, being honorary names, or
    names of consecration, as was the mode of that time. The same is to
    be said of <i>Melchizedec</i>, <i>Abimelech</i>, <i>Pharaoh</i>, and
    many more. About this time there was likewise <i>Hyas</i> a son of
    <i>Atlas</i>.</p>

  <p>The name of <i>Hermon</i> is probably deriv‚Äôd from his wife
    <i>Hermione</i>, as a compliment to her. And of this mountain is that
    saying in <i>Psalm</i> cxxxiii. 3. The psalmist draws an elegant
    comparison of the holy unction of <i>Aaron</i> running from his head to
    his beard, and so down his garments, ‚Äúlike as the dew of <i>Hermon</i>
    which falls on the hill of <i>Sion</i>.‚Äù A difficulty that gave St.
    <i>Augustin</i> a great deal of trouble; but must needs be an absurd
    reading, and ought to be corrected <i>Sirion</i> for <i>Sion</i>.
    <i>Sirion</i> is a lower part of the high ground at the bottom of mount
    <i>Hermon</i>, as that lies under the elated crest of <i>Libanus</i>.
    <i>Psal.</i> xxix. 6. ‚Äú<i>Libanon</i> also, and <i>Sirion</i>, like
    a young unicorn.‚Äù A mountain not a little remarkable, since we read,
    <i>Deut.</i> iii. 9. ‚Äúwhich <i>Hermon</i> the <i>Sidonians</i> call
    <i>Sirion</i>, and the <i>Amorites</i> call it <i>Shenir</i>;‚Äù
    <i>Hermon</i> and <i>Sirion</i> being parts of mount <i>Libanon</i>.</p>

  <p>Since we are upon criticism, the reader will excuse me in mentioning
    another of like nature, and not foreign to our purpose. These
    <i>Horites</i>, <i>Hivites</i>, <i>Avim</i> or <i>Cadmonites</i>, as
    called from <i>Cadmus</i>, <i>Gen.</i> xv. 19. or <i>Canaanites</i>,
    as called from his father <i>Canaan</i>, extending themselves upon
    the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> shore, became traders or merchants in the most
    eminent degree of all ancient people in the world, and traded as
    far as <i>Britain</i>; so that the name of <i>Canaanite</i> and
    <i>merchant</i> became equivalent. <i>Isaiah</i> xxiii. 8. ‚ÄúWho
    hath taken this counsel against <i>Tyre</i>, saith the prophet,
    the <i>crowning</i> city; whose merchants are princes, whose
    <i>traffickers</i> are the honourable of the earth.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Hence we observe, 1. The prophet calls it the <i>crowning</i> city, for
    they sent a golden crown to <i>Alexander the great</i> as a present.</p>

  <p>2. The word <i>traffickers</i>, <i>mercatores</i>, is <i>Canaanites</i>
    in the original. And the like in <i>Jerem.</i> x. 17. ‚ÄúGather up thy
    <i>wares</i> out of the land, O inhabiter of the fortress.‚Äù ‚ÄôTis
    <i>Canahe</i> in the original.</p>

  <p>3. This naturally leads me to mention a noble prophecy, overlook‚Äôd
    thro‚Äô a too literal translation in our bible, <i>Zech.</i> xiv. 21.
    ‚ÄúYea, every pot in <i>Jerusalem</i>, and in <i>Judah</i>, shall be
    holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come
    and take of them, and seethe therein. And in that day there shall be no
    more the <i>Canaanite</i> in the house of the LORD of hosts.‚Äù It ought
    to be translated <i>merchant</i>, as in the vulgate <i>latin</i> and
    <i>chaldee</i>. For ‚Äôtis a prophecy concerning the days of the Messiah;
    and regards that famous act of his life, when he drove the traders out
    of the temple.</p>

  <p>The <i>Kadmonites</i> got the name of <i>Hivites</i>, as I apprehend,
    from their ce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>lebrity in building temples of the serpentine form.
    At first they were consecrated to true religion; but too soon all
    these, and other patriarchal temples in the land of <i>Canaan</i> were
    polluted to idolatrous purposes; and probably from them the worship of
    snakes became famous. Now the word <i>Avim</i>, <i>Hev√¶us</i> in the
    <i>Syriac</i>, signifies a <i>snake</i>. And from this custom of the
    <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> making serpentine temples, the notion might arise
    of the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> worshipping serpents, as <i>Eusebius</i>
    observes, <i>pr. ev.</i> I. And from this the <i>Greeks</i> made their
    fables of <i>Cadmus</i> overcoming a great snake, sowing its teeth, and
    armed men sprouting up, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>On this account it is, that they who represent this exploit of his,
    describe it as done by a stone of a very extraordinary bulk, <i>Ovid.
    Met.</i> III. <i>v.</i> 59.</p>

  <p>It was from the city of <i>Sareptha</i> that <i>Europa</i> was carry‚Äôd
    off; ‚Äôtis in the country of <i>Sidon</i>; and I apprehend, from the
    name of it, here was originally a serpentine temple. <i>Sareptha</i>
    is the serpent <i>Ptha</i>. I have an ancient coin of this city, in
    brass. A palm-tree on one side, a leopard‚Äôs face on the other, which
    refers to the wine here famous: of which the learned <i>Reland</i> in
    <i>Palestina</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Conon</i>, in his narration 37, gives us the origin of the
    <i>greek</i> fable of <i>Cadmus</i>‚Äôs men, the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>,
    springing out of the ground armed, for before then helmets and shields
    were unknown. Hence they were call‚Äôd <i>Spart√¶</i>.</p>

  <p>That these armed men sprung out of the ground upon sowing the serpent‚Äôs
    teeth, means our <i>Hivites</i> making a religious procession along the
    avenue of their serpentine temples on the great festival days, when
    they sacrific‚Äôd. We see a like procession of armed men, carv‚Äôd upon the
    temple of <i>Persepolis</i> in <i>Le Brun</i>‚Äôs prints. And Ovid calles
    a <i>B≈ìotian</i>, one of <i>Cadmus</i>‚Äôs people, <i>Hyantius</i>, III.
    v. 147. <i>Strabo</i> vii. writes, they took that name from their king
    <i>Hyas</i>, which is the same as <i>Hivite</i>. <i>Pliny</i> iv. 7.
    observes the <i>B≈ìotians</i> were so call‚Äôd anciently.</p>

  <p>In the next book <i>Met.</i> iv. ver. 560. we have an account of
    <i>Melicerta</i> our <i>Melcarthus</i> and his mother deify‚Äôd: and of
    the <i>Sidonian</i> women their companions, some turn‚Äôd into stones,
    others into birds, for grieving at their fate. This seems to mean their
    building temples after some of the modes we have been describing,
    and that which is to follow <a href="#CHAP_XVI">Chap. XVI.</a> near the sepulchres of heroes
    and founders of states; as was the custom of old: what we observed
    by <i>Silbury-hill</i> and <i>Abury</i>. For these temples were
    prophylactick, and a sacred protection to the ashes of the defunct. So
    we read in <i>Virgil</i> by <i>Anchises</i>‚Äôs tomb, <i>√Üneid</i> V.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Immediately after <i>Ovid</i>‚Äôs account of <i>Melicerta</i>, the poet
    speaks of <i>Cadmus</i> and his wife turn‚Äôd into serpents: which I
    understand of the like serpentine temple made by their sepulchre.
    <i>Suidas</i> writes, on <i>Epaminondas</i>‚Äôs tomb was a shield and a
    snake carv‚Äôd, to shew he was of <i>Spartan</i> race. We may very well
    imagine the circle and snake, the cognizance of <i>Cadmus</i>.</p>

  <p>After <i>Cadmus</i>‚Äôs decease, his people built a city called
    <i>Butua</i>; and near it is a place call‚Äôd <i>Cylices</i>, where
    <i>Cadmus</i> and <i>Hermione</i> were turn‚Äôd into serpents: and
    two stone snakes are there set up by the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>, to
    their honour: <i>Bochart</i> page 502, where many authors are
    quoted to prove these particulars. He says, the word <i>Cylices</i>
    in <i>Ph≈ìnician</i>, means <i>tumulos</i>, our barrows. It was a
    place full of sepulchral <i>tumuli</i>, as <i>Stonehenge</i> and
    <i>Abury</i>: cups revers‚Äôd, regarding the form of them. <i>Nonnus in
    Dionys.</i> writes, that there are two great stones or rocks there,
    which clap together with a great noise, whence auguries are taken.
    <i>Tzetzes chiliad.</i> iv. <i>hist.</i> 139, mentions the same
    thing. I take this to be a main ambre, of which I spoke largely in
    <i>Stonehenge</i>. <i>Herodot.</i> V. 61. says the <i>Cadmeians</i>
    being admitted citizens of <i>Athens</i>, built temples there, which
    had nothing common with the <i>Greek</i> temples; particularly they
    had a temple of <i>Ceres Ach√¶a</i> and mystical rites. <i>Ach√¶a</i>, I
    suppose, means a serpentine temple, from the oriental name.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

  <p>We read just now, that the <i>Sidonian</i> women, the mourners for
    <i>Melcarthus</i> and his mother, were turn‚Äôd some into stones, others
    into birds.</p>

  <p class="noindent">I should suppose the internal meaning of this to be, the
    making an alate temple, of which we are further to speak in <a href="#CHAP_XVI">chap. xvi.</a></p>

  <p><i>Antoninus Liberalis</i> in his XXXI. tells a very old story of the
    first inhabitants of <i>Italy</i> before <i>Hercules</i>‚Äôs time; a
    place among the <i>Messapians</i> called the sacred stones: where the
    nymphs <i>Epimelides</i> had a fane set round with trees, which trees
    were formerly men. This must be understood as the former.</p>

  <p>Thus we see how the ancient <i>Greeks</i> involv‚Äôd every thing in
    fable, but still all fable has some historical foundation, and
    <i>that</i> we must endeavour to find, by applying things so properly
    together, as to strike out the latent truth.</p>

  <p>The learned Dr. <i>Bogan</i> in his letter prefix‚Äôd to <i>Delphi
    ph≈ìniciss.</i> from <i>√Üschylus</i> and others, <span lang="el">ŒôŒ∫ŒµœÑ. Œ¨.</span> shews, that
    men were often call‚Äôd snakes by the ancients, in an allegorical
    way; and as to the report of <i>Cadmus</i> and his wife, of the
    <i>Sidonian</i> women and others, turn‚Äôd into snakes, or stones, or
    birds, or trees, in the sense we are explaining them; ‚Äôtis no more than
    what we daily see and hear at this time, in these very Druid temples
    of our own island, which we are speaking of. The people who live at
    <i>Chippin-Norton</i> and all the country round our first described
    temple of <i>Rowldrich</i>; affirm most constantly and as surely
    believe it, that the stones composing this work are a king, his nobles
    and commons turn‚Äôd into stones. They quote an ancient proverb for it,
    concerning that tall stone, call‚Äôd the king stone.</p>

  <p class="noindent">And as Mr. <i>Roger Gale</i> wrote once to me from the
    place: ‚Äú‚Äôtis the creed of all that country, and whoever dares to
    contradict it, is looked upon as the most audacious free-thinker.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The very same report remains, at the Druid temple of
    <i>Stanton-Drew</i>, in <i>Somersetshire</i>, which I shall describe
    in my next volume. This noble monument is vulgarly call‚Äôd the
    <i>Weddings</i>; and they say,‚Äôtis a company who assisted at a nuptial
    solemnity, thus petrify‚Äôd. In an orchard near the church, is a cove
    consisting of three stones, like that of the northern circle in
    <i>Abury</i>, or that of <i>Longstones</i>: this they call the parson,
    the bride, and bridegroom. Other circles are said to be the company
    dancing: and a separate parcel of stones standing a little from the
    rest, are call‚Äôd the fidlers, or the band of musick.</p>

  <p>So that vast circle of stones in <i>Cumberland</i> which was a Druid
    temple, is call‚Äôd <i>long Meg and her daughters</i>, and verily
    believed to have been human, turn‚Äôd into stones.</p>

  <p>Thus we see an exact uniformity between the fables of the antient
    <i>Greeks</i>, and our present people. The former found these kind of
    patriarchal temples built by their first heroes and planters; admiring
    the vastness of the works, they affix‚Äôd these marvellous stories to
    them, and retain them as firmly, as our vulgar do the like now. And
    this is the nature of the ancient mythology; but by finding the end of
    the clue, we draw it out into useful truths.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

  <p>These <i>Cadmonites</i>, <i>Avim</i>, <i>Hittites</i>, <i>Hivites</i>,
    <i>Spartans</i>, <i>Lacedemonians</i>, (who are all one and the same
    people,) retain‚Äôd a distinct remembrance of their relation to the
    <i>Jews</i>, even to the days of the <i>Maccabees</i>, as we read 1.
    <i>Maccab.</i> xii. and in <i>Josephus</i> Ant. xii. 5. Undoubtedly
    they reckoned themselves of kin to <i>Abraham</i>, if not descended
    from him; thus I understand it. <i>Joshua</i> mentions chap. xi. the
    <i>Hivites</i> in the land of <i>Mizpeh</i> under mount <i>Hermon</i>
    by <i>Libanus</i>. He says further, in the 19th verse, the
    <i>Gibeonites</i> were a portion of that same people. The <i>Avim</i>
    or <i>Horites</i> about mount <i>Seir</i> where <i>Esau</i> dwelt,
    were the same people who were expell‚Äôd by the <i>Caphthorim</i>, as
    <i>Moses</i> mentions: on which bishop <i>Cumberland</i> has wrote
    largely.</p>

  <p>We read of the great intercourse there was between <i>Esau</i>‚Äôs
    family and these people; for <i>Esau</i> married four of his wives
    from them, <i>Gen.</i> xxvi. 34. xxxvi. 2. no doubt but they married
    into his family again. Hence it is that <i>Strabo</i> x. writes, that
    <i>Cadmus</i> had <i>Arabians</i> in his company. And in xvi. that the
    inhabitants of <i>Syria</i> (he means properly <i>Ph≈ìnicia</i>) are
    originally deriv‚Äôd from the neighbourhood of the <i>Persian gulf</i>.</p>

  <p>I doubt not but that there are now upon the face of the earth, many of
    these serpentine temples remaining in <i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia</i> and
    <i>Africa</i>. For instance, <i>Strabo</i> xvi. from <i>Posidonius</i>
    relates, that in a field call‚Äôd <i>Macra</i> by <i>Damascus</i>, was a
    dead serpent, the length of an acre, so thick that two horsemen could
    not see each other across him, his mouth so large as a horseman might
    enter into it; each scale was as big as a shield.</p>

  <p>We may hence see the origin of idolatry, soon after these heroes we
    have recited; and it seems to have begun first in <i>Ph≈ìnicia</i>,
    which <i>Eusebius</i> always puts before <i>Egypt</i>, when speaking
    of the matter. <i>Demaroon</i> was <i>Jupiter</i> the supreme,
    <i>Phut</i> they deify‚Äôd into his son, <i>Canaan</i> they made the
    third divine person. But wherever idolatry began, whether in the call
    of <i>Asia</i>, or the west, it flew too soon into other countries,
    and they made a <i>Jupiter</i>, a <i>Son</i>, and a <i>Mercury</i> or
    <i>Neptune</i> who are the same, of their own; ‚Äôtill with every hero
    and benefactor to mankind they fill‚Äôd the heaven of the heathens.</p>

    <i>A metaphysical disquisition concerning the nature of the
    deity, shewing how the Druids, by the strength of reason, might
    arrive to the knowledge of a divine emanation or person, from
    the supreme first cause, which we call the Son of God; and the
    necessity of admitting of such an emanation. All the philosophers
    and priests of antiquity had this notion; as we read in</i> Plato
    <i>and many more.</i>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">I &nbsp;HAVE</span> given the reader an account of three eminent builders of these
    <i>Dracontia</i>, or serpentine temples, in the earliest times after
    the flood, and in the more eastern parts of the world; as well as
    described one of those works in our island. There are many more such
    builders and buildings, which will be easily found out by those that
    are conversant in ancient learning. This figure of the circle and
    snake, on which they are founded, had obtained a very venerable regard,
    in being expressive of the most eminent and illustrious act of the
    deity, the multiplication of his own nature, as the <i>Zoroastrians</i>
    and <i>Platonists</i> speak; and in being a symbol of that divine
    person who was the consequence of it.</p>

  <p>We shall not wonder that the Druids had a perception of this great
    truth, when we consider that it was known, as far as necessary, to all
    the philosophic and religious sects of antiquity, as shewn at large by
    several learned writers. My opinion is, that it was communicated to
    mankind, originally, by God himself. ‚ÄôTis the highest point of wisdom
    which the human mind can arrive at, to understand somewhat of the
    nature of the deity; and the studious, the pious, and thinking part of
    the world, would not fail to improve this knowledge by reflexion and
    ratiocination.</p>

  <p>Tho‚Äô my business is to speak more fully of the religion of the Druids
    in the next volume, yet I judge it very pertinent to the present
    subject to anticipate that intention, so as to shew how far they might
    advance toward that knowledge, by the dint of reason; to further the
    works, wherein they have, in the largest characters that ever were
    made, consign‚Äôd their notions of this sort, remaining to this day, such
    as we have been describing; and which may induce us to have the same
    sentiment concerning them as <i>Pere Marten</i> in his <i>Religion
    des Gaulois</i>, tho‚Äô he knew nothing of our antiquities; but thus he
    writes, ‚Äúthat the Druids worship‚Äôd the true God, and that their ideas
    of religion were truly grand, sublime, magnificent.‚Äù</p>

  <p>We may therefore very justly affirm of them, that in their serious
    contemplations in this place, concerning the nature of the deity,
    which, as <i>C√¶sar</i> tells us, was one part of their inquiries, they
    would thus reason in their own minds.</p>

  <p>A contemplative person, viewing and considering the world around him,
    is ravish‚Äôd with the harmony and beauty, the fitnesses of things in it,
    the uses and connexion of all its parts, and the infinite agreement
    shining throughout the whole. He must belye all his senses to doubt,
    that it was compos‚Äôd by a being of infinite power, wisdom and goodness,
    which we call God. But among all the most glorious attributes of
    divinity, goodness is preeminent. For this beautiful fabric of the
    world displays thro‚Äô every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> atom of it, such an amazing scene of
    the goodness and beneficence of its author; that it appears to such
    contemplative minds, that his infinite power and wisdom were but as the
    two hands, employ‚Äôd by the <i>goodness</i> of the sovereign architect.</p>

  <p>Goodness was the beginning, the middle, the end of the creation. To
    explain, to prove, or illustrate this topic, would be an affront to the
    common understanding of mankind. The sum of what we can know of him
    is, that he is good, essentially good. We are not more assured of the
    existence of the first being, than that he is good, <i>the</i> good,
    goodness itself, in eminence. He is God, because he is good; which is
    the meaning of the word in <i>english</i>, and in many other languages.
    This, in God almighty, is the attribute of attributes, the perfection
    of his all-perfect nature. He made and maintains those creatures which
    he multiply‚Äôd to an infinite degree, the objects of his care and
    beneficence; those great characters of supreme love, that render him
    deservedly adorable.</p>

  <p>All possible perfections, both moral and natural, must needs be
    inherent in this first and supreme being, because from him alone they
    can flow. This is in one comprehensive word, what we call good. But
    good unexercis‚Äôd, unemploy‚Äôd, incommunicate, is no good, and implies
    a contradiction, when affirmed of the all-good being. Therefore it
    undeniably follows, there never was a time, never can be, when God was
    useless, and did not communicate of his goodness.</p>

  <p>But there was a time before creation, before this beautiful fabric of
    the world was made, before even chaos itself, or the production of
    the rude matter, of which the world was made. And this time must be
    affirmed, not only as to material creation, but to that of angels and
    spiritual beings. Reckon we never so many ages, or myriads of ages,
    for the commencement of creation, yet it certainly began, and there
    was a time before that beginning. For, by the definition, creation is
    bringing that into being which was not before. There must have been a
    time before it.</p>

  <p>Here then occurs the difficulty, of filling up that infinite gap before
    creation. Consider the supreme first being sitting in the center of
    an universal solitude, environ‚Äôd with the abyss of infinite nothing,
    a chasm of immense vacuity! what words can paint the greatness of the
    solecism? what mind does not start at the horror of such an absurdity?
    and especially supposing this state subsisted from infinite ages.</p>

  <p>‚ÄôTis in vain to pretend, that a being of all perfections can be happy
    in himself, in the consciousness of those perfections, whilst he
    does no good to any thing; in the reflexive idea of his possessing
    all excellency, whilst he exerts no tittle of any one. This is the
    picture of a being quite dissonant to that of the All-good. And as
    the Druids would, without difficulty, judge, that there must needs be
    one, only, self-originated first being, the origin of all things: so
    they would see the necessity of admitting one or more eternal beings,
    or emanations from that first being, in a manner quite distinct from
    creation.</p>

  <p>That there ever was one eternal, self-existent, unoriginated being,
    is the very first and most necessary truth, which the human mind
    can possibly, by contemplation and ratiocination, obtain. Still by
    considering the matter intimately, they would find it impossible to
    conceive, that there should ever be a time, when there was but one
    being in the universe, which we call the first and self-originated
    being, possessing in himself all possible perfections, and remaining
    for endless myriads of ages, torpid, unactive, solitary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> useless.
    This is a notion so abhorrent to reason, so contrary to the nature of
    goodness, so absolutely absurd, that we may as well imagine this great
    being altogether absent, and that there was no being at all.</p>

  <p>This all the philosophers were sensible of, for good unexercis‚Äôd, that
    always lay dormant, never was put into act, is no goodness; it may as
    well be supposed absent, and even that there was no God. To imagine
    that God could be asleep all this while, shocks the mind, therefore it
    casts about, to remedy this great paradox.</p>

  <p>Now it cannot be said of any part of creation, or of the whole, that
    God always did good to any created being or beings; for these are not,
    cannot be commensurate in time with his own being. Count backward never
    so long for the beginning of things, still there was a time prior to
    this beginning of things; for eternal creation is an equal absurdity
    with an eternal absence of any being: where no part is necessary, to
    affirm the whole is a necessarily and self-existing being, is a mere
    portent of reason.</p>

  <p>So we see, in every light, an absolute necessity of admitting a being
    or beings coeval with the supreme and self-originated being, distinct
    from any creation, and which must needs flow from the first being, the
    cause of all existence. For two self-originated beings is as much an
    absurdity as any of the preceding.</p>

  <p>But, as ‚Äôtis impossible that the act of creation should be coeval with
    the first being, what other act of goodness can be? For that being
    which is essentially good, must ever have been actively and actually
    so. To answer this great question, we must thus expostulate, as the
    prophet <i>Isaiah</i> does in the person of God, in his last chapter,
    when summing up the business of his prophetical office: ‚ÄúShall I bring
    to the birth, and not beget, saith <i>Jehovah</i>: shall I cause to
    bring forth, and be myself barren, saith thy God?‚Äù He is there speaking
    of the birth of the son of God in human form; but we may apply it in a
    more eminent degree, to the son of God in his divine nature; and as the
    Druids may well be suppos‚Äôd to have done. The highest act of goodness
    which is possible, even for the supreme being, is the production of
    his like, the act of filiation, the begetting of his son, <i>Prov.</i>
    viii. 22. ‚ÄúThe <span class="gespertt1">LORD</span> <i>begat</i> me <i>from eternity</i>, before his
    works of old;‚Äù (so it ought to be read) <i>ver.</i> 30. ‚Äúthen I was by
    him, as one <i>brought up</i> with him (<i>amoun</i> in the original)
    and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.‚Äù</p>

  <p>This is the internal divine fecundity of the fruitful cause of all
    things. Creation is external fecundity. The Druids would naturally
    apply the term generation, to this act of producing this person, or
    divine emanation from the supreme, which we are oblig‚Äôd to admit
    of: and to affirm him coeval with the supreme. The difficulty of
    priority in time, between father and son, would easily be remov‚Äôd, by
    considering the difference between divine and human generation, the
    production of necessary and contingent beings.</p>

  <p>If an artist produces an admirable and curious piece of mechanism, he
    is said to make it; if he produces a person or being altogether like
    himself, he is rightly said to generate that person; he begets a son,
    ‚Äôtis an act of filiation. So the like we must affirm of the supreme
    being generating another being, with whom only he could communicate
    of his goodness from all eternity, and without any beginning; or, in
    scripture language, <i>in whom he always had complacency</i>. This is
    what <i>Plato</i> means, ‚Äúby love being ancienter than all the gods;
    that the kingdom of love is prior to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> kingdom of necessity.‚Äù And
    this son must be a self-existent, all-perfect being, equally as the
    father, self-origination only excepted, which the necessary relation or
    oeconomy between them forbids. If he is a son, he is like himself; if
    he is like himself, he is God; if he is God, an eternity of existence
    is one necessary part of his divine nature and perfection.</p>

  <p>If the son be of the same substance and nature as the father, an
    eternity of being is one part of his nature; therefore no time can
    be assign‚Äôd for this divine geniture, and it must be what we call
    eternal. Or perhaps we may express it as well by saying, it was before
    eternity; or that he is coeval with the almighty father. In this
    same sense <i>Proclus de patriarch.</i> uses the word <span lang="el">œÄœÅŒøŒ±ŒπœéŒΩŒπŒøœÇ</span>,
    <i>pr√¶eternus</i>. For tho‚Äô ‚Äôtis impossible that creation, whether of
    material or immaterial beings, should be coeval with God; yet, if the
    son be of the same nature with the father, which must be granted, then
    ‚Äôtis impossible to be otherwise, than that the son of God should be
    coeval with the father.</p>

  <p>If goodness be, as it were, the essence of God, then he can have no
    happiness but in the exercise of that goodness. We must not say,
    as many are apt to do, that he was always and infinitely happy, in
    reflecting upon his own being and infinite perfections, in the idea of
    himself. This is no exercise of goodness, unless we allow this idea of
    himself which he produces, to be a being without him, or distinct from
    himself; and that is granting what we contend for. A true and exact
    idea of himself is the <i>logos</i> of the ancients, the first-born of
    the first cause. And this is the meaning of what the eastern and all
    other philosophers assert, ‚Äúthat it was necessary for unity to make
    an evolution of itself, and multiply; it was necessary for good to
    communicate itself. There could be no time before then, for then he
    would be an imperfect unity, and may as well be termed a cypher, which
    of itself can never produce any thing.‚Äù Agreeable to this doctrine,
    <i>Philo in</i> II. <i>de monarchiis</i>, writes, ‚Äúthe <i>logos</i> is
    the express image of God, and by whom all the whole world was made.‚Äù
    It would be senseless to think here, he meant only the wisdom of the
    supreme, the reason, the cunning of God, a quality, not a personality.</p>

  <p>What difficulty here is in the thing, arises merely from the weakness
    of our conceptions, and in being conversant only with ordinary
    generation. A son of ours is of the same nature as his father. His
    father was begat in time, therefore the son the like. Not so in
    divine generation. But as the father is from eternity, so is the son.
    This only difference there is, or rather distinction; the father is
    self-existent, and unoriginate; the son is of the father.</p>

  <p>Further, we must remove, in this kind of reasoning, all the
    imperfection of different sexes, as well as time, which is in human
    generations; and all such gross ideas incompatible with the most pure
    and perfect divine nature. The whole of this our reasoning further
    confirms, that the son is necessarily existing. It was necessary
    for God to be actively good always, and begetting his son was the
    greatest act of divine goodness, and the first, necessarily. But the
    word <i>first</i> is absurd, betraying our own imperfection of speech
    and ideas, when we treat of these matters; for there could be no
    <i>first</i>, where no beginning. And the very names of father and son
    are but relative and oeconomical; so far useful, that we may be able
    to entertain some tolerable notion in these things, so far above our
    understanding.</p>

  <p>But tho‚Äô it be infinitely above our understanding, yet we reach so
    far, as to see the necessity of it. And we can no otherwise cure
    that immense <i>vacuum</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> that greatest of all absurdities, the
    indolence and uselesness of the supreme being, before creation. And
    all this the Druids might, and I may venture to say, did arrive at,
    by ratiocination. And we can have no difficulty of admitting it,
    if we do but suppose, there were obscure notions of such being the
    nature of the deity, handed down from the beginning of the world.
    Whence in <i>Chronicon Alexandrinum</i>, <i>Malala</i>, and other
    authors, we read, for instance, ‚Äúin those times (the most early)
    among the <i>Egyptians</i> reigned, of the family of <i>Misraim</i>,
    <i>Sesosiris</i>, that is, the branch or offspring of <i>Osiris</i>, a
    man highly venerable for wisdom, who taught, there were three greatest
    energies or persons in the deity, which were but one.‚Äù This man was
    <i>Lud</i>, or <i>Thoth</i>, son of <i>Misraim</i> or <i>Osiris</i>,
    and for this reason, when idolatry began, he was consecrated by the
    name of <i>Hermes</i>, meaning one of those divine energies, which we
    call the Holy Spirit.</p>

  <p>This is a short and easy account of that knowledge which the ancients
    had of the nature of the deity, deduc‚Äôd from reason in a contemplative
    mind, and which certainly was known to all the world from the
    beginning, and rightly call‚Äôd a mystery. For our reason is strong
    enough to see the necessity of admitting this doctrine, but not to
    see the manner. The <i>how</i> of an eternal generation is only to be
    understood by the deity itself.</p>

  <p>The Druids would pursue this notion from like reasoning a little
    further, in this manner. Tho‚Äô from all that has been said, there is
    a necessity of admitting an eternal generation, yet the person so
    generated, all-perfect God, does not multiply the deity itself, tho‚Äô he
    is a person distinct from his father. For addition or subtraction is
    argument of imperfection, a thing not to be affirmed of the nature of
    the deity. They would therefore say, that tho‚Äô these two, the father
    and the son, are different divine personalities, yet they cannot be
    called two Gods, or two godheads; for this would be discerping the
    deity or godhead, which is equally absurd and wicked.</p>

  <p>That mankind did formerly reason in this wise, is too notorious to
    need my going about formally to prove it. ‚ÄôTis not to be controverted;
    very many authors have done it substantially. And when there was
    such a notion in the world, our Druids, who had the highest fame for
    theological studies, would cultivate it in some such manner as I have
    deliver‚Äôd, by the mere strength of natural reason. Whether they would
    think in this manner <i>ex priori</i>, I cannot say; but that they did
    so think, we can need no weightier an argument than the operose work
    of <i>Abury</i> before us; for nought else could induce men to make
    such a stamp, such a picture of their own notion, as this stupendous
    production of labour and art.</p>

  <p>As our western philosophers made a huge picture of this their idea,
    in a work of three miles‚Äô extent, and, as it were, shaded by the
    interposition of divers hills; so the more eastern sages who were
    not so shy of writing, yet, chose to express it in many obscure and
    enigmatic ways. <i>Pythagoras</i>, for instance, affirmed, the original
    of all things was from unity and an infinite duality. <i>Plutarc.
      de plac. philos.</i> <i>Plato</i> makes three divine authors of all
    things, the first or supreme he calls king, the good. Beside him,
    he names the cause, descended from the former; and between them he
    names <i>dux</i>, the leader, or at other times he calls him the
    <i>mind</i>. Just in the same manner, the <i>Egyptians</i> called them
    <i>father</i>, <i>mind</i>, <i>power</i>. Therefore <i>Plato</i>, in
    his VIth epistle, writing to <i>Hermias</i> and his friends, to enter
    into a most solemn oath, directs it to be made before ‚ÄúGod the leader
    or prince of all things, both that are, and that shall be; and before
    the Lord, the father of that leader or prince; and of the cause: all
    whom, says he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
    we shall know manifestly, if we philosophize rightly,
    as far as the powers of good men will carry us.‚Äù And in <i>Tim√¶us</i>
    he makes <span class="gespertt1">MIND</span> to be the son of <span class="gespertt1">GOOD</span>, and to be the more immediate
    architect of the world. And in <i>Epinomis</i> he writes, ‚Äúthe most
    divine <span class="gespertt1">LOGOS</span> or <span class="gespertt1">WORD</span> made the world,‚Äù the like as <i>Philo</i> wrote;
    which is expressly a christian verity.</p>

  <p>‚ÄôTis not to be wonder‚Äôd at, that the ancients wrap‚Äôd up this doctrine
    in an abstruse and symbolic way of speaking, of writing, and in
    hieroglyphic characters and works, as we have seen. It was communicated
    to them in the same manner; they did not, could not comprehend it any
    more than we, but they held it as a precious depositum of sacred wisdom.</p>

  <p>We may therefore make this deduction from what has been said, that the
    christian doctrine of distinct personalities in the deity, is so far
    from being contrary to reason, as some would have it, or above human
    reason as others, that ‚Äôtis evidently deducible therefrom, at least
    highly agreeable thereto, when seriously propos‚Äôd to our reason. And
    when most undoubtedly the ancients had such a notion, even from the
    creation, those minds that were of a contemplative turn, would embrace
    it and cultivate it, as being the most exalted knowledge we are capable
    of. Of such a turn were our Druids, as all accounts agree.</p>

    <i>Of the third species of patriarchal temples, form‚Äôd in the
    resemblance of a circle and wings. A description of one of this
    sort on the banks of the</i> Humber <i>in</i> Lincolnshire.
    <i>A very remarkable sort of barrows there, like to beds. This
    figure of the alate circle, the</i> Egyptians <i>call‚Äôd by the
    name of</i> CNEPH; <i>authors mistake in telling us it was
    the name of God. ‚ÄôTis indeed the symbol of the third divine

    <i>The entire symbol, circle, snake and wings, was call‚Äôd</i>
    CNEPHPTHA. Ptha <i>more particularly meant the serpent, or

    be ineffable, as well as invisible, therefore symboliz‚Äôd him by
    the circle. The Neptune of the</i> Greeks <i>deriv‚Äôd from</i>

    circulus alatus. <i>He was president of the waters, from</i>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="gespertt1">WHEN</span> I wrote my <i>Itinerary</i>, I travelled a good deal of the
    <i>Hermen-street</i> road, and the <i>Foss</i> road, having Mr.
    <i>Samuel Buck</i> in my company. At that time I engag‚Äôd him to
    take in hand the work, which he has so laudably pursued, and sav‚Äôd
    the remembrance of innumerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> antiquities in our island, by that
    collection of elegant prints which he has publish‚Äôd. When we were on
    the banks of the <i>Humber</i>, the name of <i>Barrow</i> invited
    my curiosity, and it was fully answer‚Äôd, by finding that most noble
    antiquity there of the old Druids, upon the <i>marsh</i>, call‚Äôd
    <i>Humbers castle</i>.</p>

  <p>A rivulet rises near the town of <i>Barrow</i>, and when it falls off
    the high ground, and enters on the level marshes on the <a href="#tab_XXXVIII"><i>Humber</i></a>
    shore, it turns a mill. Just there, upon the edge of the marsh, upon a
    gentle eminence, nearly overflow‚Äôd by high spring-tides, and between
    the salt and fresh water, is the work we are to speak of, made of
    great banks of earth thrown up, in an odd manner, which gives it the
    denomination of castle. I observ‚Äôd all about it, and in the adjacent
    marshes, many long <i>tumuli</i> of different sizes, but all of a
    particular shape, such as I had never seen elsewhere, being form‚Äôd like
    a bed. I immediately set to work in digging into several of them, and
    we found burnt bones, ashes, bits of urns, and such kind of matters,
    all extremely rotten and decay‚Äôd; and the very same appearances as I
    had so often seen, in digging the barrows about <i>Stonehenge</i> and
    <i>Abury</i>.</p>

  <p>This satisfied me that the work must belong to the most ancient
    inhabitants of the island, notwithstanding its unusual form. And when I
    attentively consider‚Äôd those banks, and made a plan of them, I was very
    agreeably surpriz‚Äôd in discovering the purport and meaning, which was
    to represent the <i>circulus alatus</i> or winged circle, an ancient
    hieroglyphic well known to those more particularly conversant with
    <i>Egyptian</i> monuments; and what they rightly call the symbol of the
    <i>anima mundi</i>, or <i>spirit pervading the universe</i>; in truth,
    the divine spirit.</p>

  <p>I had no hesitation in adjudging this to be a temple of our Druids. All
    reasons imaginable concurr‚Äôd. Tho‚Äô instead of stones, they have made
    this work with mounds of earth; I suppose for want of stones, lying on
    the surface of the ground. It makes the third kind of the Druid temples
    which I proposed to describe. The vertical line of it is north-east and
    south-west, the upper part being directly north-east; and the barrows
    generally conform to this line, being either upon it, or at right
    angles with it; the head of the barrow sometimes one way, sometimes the
    other.</p>

  <p>The circle was 120 cubits in diameter. The wings 100 cubits broad, 150
    long; but the eastern wing was more extended than the other. For the
    design of it is somewhat in perspective, as ‚Äôtis sometimes seen on
    <i>Egyptian</i> antiquities.</p>

  <p>This very extraordinary work, which I could not sufficiently admire,
    has very often entertain‚Äôd my thoughts. We see an uniformity in
    human nature throughout all ages. We build our churches, especially
    cathedrals, in a cross, the symbol or cognizance of Christianity; the
    first builders of churches did it in the symbol of the deity, which
    was pictur‚Äôd out with great judgment, and that (most likely) from the
    beginning of the world.</p>

  <p>The circle and wings was the picture of the deity, which the old
    <i>Egyptian</i> hierophants call‚Äôd <span class="gespertt1">CNEPH</span>. As there were three
    varieties in this figure, so they had more names than one for it, I
    mean the whole figure, the circle, serpent, and wings. And sometimes
    they used one word, sometimes another, and sometimes conjoin‚Äôd
    them. <i>Eusebius</i> in <i>pr. ev.</i> III. 3. writes, ‚Äúthat the
    <i>Egyptians</i> painted God, whom they call‚Äôd <i>Kneph</i>, like a
    man in a blue garment, holding a circle and serpent (not scepter, for
    no such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
    figure ever appears) and on his head, feathers or wings.‚Äù Now
    this very figure is seen on the portals of the <i>Persian</i> temple
    of <i>Chilminar</i>. Authors are not sufficiently accurate in these
    matters, for want of a more perfect knowledge of them. <i>Cneph</i> is
    properly the alate circle; yet sometimes they call the whole figure by
    that name. So a feather or two, or wings, are often plac‚Äôd on the heads
    of the <i>Egyptian</i> deities; but the picture above-mention‚Äôd at
    <i>Chilminar</i> has the wings, as more commonly, annexed to the circle.</p>

  <p><i>Phtha</i> was another name of one of these figures, which they
    sometimes join‚Äôd to the preceding, and made the word <i>Cnephtha</i>.
    <i>Kircher</i> erroneously calls it <i>Hemptha</i>; for before him
    <i>Iamblichus</i> err‚Äôd in calling <i>Cneph</i>, <i>Emeph</i>.
    <i>Strabo</i> calls <i>Cneph</i>, <i>Cnuphis</i>, and says his temple
    was at <i>Syene</i>, XVII. Undoubtedly a temple some way of this form.
    <i>Athenagoras in Eroticis</i> VI. calls him <span lang="el">ŒöŒΩŒµœÜŒ±ŒπŒøœÇ</span>, <i>Cnepheus</i>;
    and says, ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt be seen by our eyes, nor comprehended by our mind.‚Äù
    <i>Hesychius</i>, and the etymologist <i>Suidas</i>, <i>voce</i>
    <span lang="el">Œ∫ŒΩŒµœÜœÖœÇ</span>, interpret the word, <i>obscure</i>, <i>hidden</i>, <i>not to be
    seen or understood</i>. <i>Iamblichus</i> and <i>Proclus</i> the like,
    who make <i>Am√ªn</i> and <i>Phtha</i> the same, <i>Prov.</i> viii. 30.
    The truth is, the word <i>Cneph</i> comes from the <i>hebrew</i> <span lang="he">◊¢◊†◊£</span>
    <i>ganaph volare</i>, to <i>fly</i>, <span lang="he">◊ß◊†◊£</span> a <i>wing</i>, <i>Psal.</i>
    xviii. 11. <i>He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly.</i></p>

  <p><i>Phtha</i>, in <i>Suidas</i> called <span lang="el">œÜŒ∏Œ¨œÇ</span>, is deriv‚Äôd, on the
    authority of <i>Kircher</i> and <i>Huetius</i>, from the <i>hebrew</i>
    <span lang="he">◊§◊™◊î</span> the same as the <i>greek</i> word <span lang="el">œÄŒµŒπŒ∏œâ</span>, to <i>persuade</i>,
    <i>suada</i> in <i>latin</i>. It regards more particularly the serpent,
    the emblem of eloquence, and the divine <span class="gespertt1">WORD</span>. In <i>Arabic</i> it
    signifies the <i>son</i>. So that <i>Cnephtha</i> means the entire
    figure, the circle, snake and wings. The supreme had no name. They
    held him ineffable, as well as invisible. Whence they call‚Äôd the
    <i>Jehovah</i> of the <i>jews</i> an uncertain or unknown deity, or the
    deity without a name. <i>Herodotus in Euterpe</i> writes, ‚Äúhe heard
    from the priests of <i>Dodona</i>, that the ancient <i>Pelasgians</i>
    made their prayers and sacrifices to the deity without any name
    or sirname, for at that time they knew none.‚Äù <i>Iamblichus</i>‚Äôs
    interpretation of <i>Phtha</i> is very little different. He says, ‚ÄúIt
    signifies him that performs all things in truth, and without lying.‚Äù
    The <i>Egyptians</i> called this <i>Phtha Vulcan</i>, and say, he was
    the son of the supreme God; whom <i>Cicero</i> makes the guardian
    god of <i>Egypt</i>, who was the author of all the philosophy of the
    <i>Egyptians</i>, according to <i>Diogenes Laertius in proem.</i>
    And this is that most ancient deity of the <i>Egyptians</i> who was
    particularly design‚Äôd by the serpent. And hence the fables of the
    <i>greeks</i> make <i>Vulcan</i> the only son of <i>Juno</i>, without
    the help of her husband. Again, they make <i>Pallas</i> produc‚Äôd out of
    <i>Jupiter</i>‚Äôs brain, who wore the <i>√Ügis</i> or snaky breast-plate,
    which originally was no other than our great prophylactic hierogramma,
    the circle and snake, us‚Äôd by the most ancient warriors as a sacred
    preservative. <i>Medusa</i>‚Äôs head is the very same, a circle, wings,
    and snakes. But the delicate <i>greeks</i> new drest it, and made the
    circle into a beautiful face, more agreeable to their taste of things.
    And its turning men into stones means, at the bottom, nothing but the
    making our serpentine temples in that form by the first heroes, who
    bore this cognizance in their shields.</p>

  <p>But to return to <span class="gespertt1">CNEPH</span>, the deity to whom these winged temples
    are dedicate. It became the chief and more famous name. Whence
    <i>Porphyry</i> in <i>Eusebius</i>‚Äôs <i>pr. ev.</i> III. 11. calls this
    <i>Cneph</i> the creator, <i>Plutarch, de Is. &amp; Os.</i> testifies, ‚Äúthe
    inhabitants in <i>Thebais</i>, or the remotest part of <i>Egypt</i>,
    worshipped only the eternal God <i>Cneph</i>, and paid nothing toward
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
    the charge of idolatrous worship in the other parts of that kingdom.‚Äù
    Thus we see, those countries farthest separated from the busy part of
    the world, such as <i>Thebais</i> and <i>Britain</i>, retain‚Äôd the
    pure and ancient religion: which bishop <i>Cumberland</i> too asserts,
    <i>Sanchon.</i> p. 15. of <i>Thebais</i>, before <i>Abraham</i>‚Äôs time.
    <i>Strabo</i> says, ‚Äúthere was a temple of <i>Cnuphis</i> (as he writes
    it) at <i>Syene</i>, the farther part of <i>Thebais</i>:‚Äù which must
    be understood of one of our winged temples originally, tho‚Äô probably
    afterwards built upon, cover‚Äôd, and become idolatrous. ‚ÄúHence the
    <i>Ethiopians</i>, neighbours to those of <i>Thebais</i>, living still
    in the upper regions of <i>Egypt</i>,‚Äù says <i>Strabo</i>, ‚Äúworship
    two gods, the one the immortal creator, the other mortal, who has
    no name, nor is easily to be apprehended.‚Äù Here we find they have a
    notion of the supreme and his son. Their opposite neighbours across the
    <i>red sea</i>, worshipped only two gods, <span lang="el">œÑŒøŒΩ ŒîŒπŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒîŒπŒøŒΩœÖœÉŒøŒΩ</span>,
    <i>Jovem &amp; Jovem Nys√¶um</i>, God, and the God of <i>Nysa</i>. This is
    what is meant by the two principles of <i>Pythagoras</i>, mention‚Äôd
    by <i>Plutarch de plac. philos.</i> unity and indefinite duality, the
    sacred <i>Dyas</i> of <i>Plato</i>. Whence <i>Diodorus</i> in his
    I. writes, ‚Äúthat the <i>Egyptians</i> declar‚Äôd there were two first
    eternal Gods.‚Äù These they express‚Äôd by the names of <i>unity</i> and
    <i>duality</i>. I do not believe that they found this out by their own
    understanding and reasoning, but had it from patriarchal tradition.
    And then their own reasoning would confirm it. For it is altogether
    agreeable to reason, arguing from the fecundity of the first cause.
    The <i>Greeks</i> turned <i>Cneph</i> into their <i>Neptune</i>, the
    sovereign of the waters, from what the <i>hebrew</i> legislator writes
    in the beginning of his <i>cosmogony</i>; ‚Äúand the spirit of God moved
    upon the face of the waters.‚Äù The word <i>Neptune</i> comes from
    <i>Cneph</i> and <span lang="he">◊ì◊†◊ô◊ê</span> <i>Dunia</i>, <i>orbis</i>, <i>circulus</i>,
    the <i>winged circle</i>. And this probably will give us some light
    into the reason, why we find our winged temple of <i>Barrow</i> upon
    the banks of that noble √¶stuary, the <i>Humber</i>. I wonder‚Äôd indeed
    how it should come about, that the Druids should so studiously place
    this work under the verge of the high land, and upon the brink of the
    salt marsh; so that every high tide washes or overflows the skirts
    of it, whilst the freshwater brook runs close under it. At this time
    it must have presented them with the agreeable picture of the sacred
    hieroglyphic, hovering over both fresh and salt-water.</p>

  <p>I observ‚Äôd a line, or little bank and ditch, cast up above our figure,
    which I judg‚Äôd to be done with an intent to keep off the inundation of
    the ocean at the times of sacrifice, which seems to have been perform‚Äôd
    within that inclos‚Äôd area, where I have set the figure of the compass
    in the engraven view. Likewise just without that line, eastward, I
    remarked three little square plots, which perhaps were habitations of
    the Druids who were keepers of the temple.</p>

  <p>‚ÄôTis not from the purpose to take notice of one of the greatest fix‚Äôd
    stars of the heavens, at the bottom of the constellation call‚Äôd the
    <i>ship</i>, having the name of <i>Canopus</i>, which is no other
    than our word <i>Cneph</i>. This star had this name given it by the
    <i>Egyptians</i>, as appearing to them just above the edge of the
    southern horizon. And in their spheres, we may very well presume,
    they painted it as a winged circle, and because it always appear‚Äôd as
    hovering over the horizon or great ocean.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">So that originally the ancients understood the spirit or soul of
    the universe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> or more properly the divine spirit, by this figure
    which they call‚Äôd <span class="gespertt1">KNEPH</span>, which the <i>European</i> nations call‚Äôd
    <i>Neptune</i>, sovereign of the waters. So often by the poets call‚Äôd
    <span lang="el">ŒïŒΩŒøœÉŒπœáŒ∏œâŒΩ, ŒïŒΩŒøœÉŒπŒ≥Œ±ŒπœâŒΩ,</span> the <i>shaker of the earth</i>; for the waters
    in <i>Moses</i> means the <i>Hyle</i>, or moist matter of chaos whence
    the universe was made.</p>

  <p>Two of the quarterly solemnities or general sacrifices of the Druids
    were on the two equinoxes, when are the highest tides. A curious
    observer being upon the spot, for some years together, at these times,
    might possibly make some notable discovery concerning the difference
    of the surface of the sea, since the current of 5 or 6000 years: for
    I persuade myself this temple was made by the very first inhabitants
    of the isle, and not long after the flood, on account of the interment
    here of some great hero, that advanc‚Äôd so far in peopling the country.
    And if our reasonings and testimonies hitherto be any whit agreeable
    to truth, we may point out the species of many of these most ancient
    temples built at the place of sepulture of heroes, spoken of in
    writings of those times. For instance, we infer a serpentine temple
    was made by the <i>tumulus</i> of <i>Orpheus</i>, from the fable of
    a serpent offering to devour his head, which serpent was turn‚Äôd into
    stone.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry" lang="la">

  <p>Again, we may reasonably suppose that an alate temple was built by the
    tomb of <i>Memnon</i>, said to be buried in <i>Phrygia</i>, who was
    turn‚Äôd into a bird on the funeral pile, at the request of his mother
    <i>Aurora</i>. We see some hints of it even from <i>Ovid</i>‚Äôs telling
    the story. This was done at the request of his mother <i>Aurora</i>,
    who petitions <i>Jupiter</i> for this favour to her son, for herself
    she desires none. Thus she begins:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry" lang="la">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0"><i>Omnibus inferior, quas sustinet aureus √¶ther</i></div>
        <div class="i0">(<i>Nam mihi sunt totum rarissima templa per orbem</i>,)</div>
        <div class="i0"><i>Diva tamen venio: non ut delubra, diesque</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>Des mihi sacrificos, caliturasque ignibus aras</i>, &amp;c.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">He was turn‚Äôd into a bird, and a flock of the same birds,
    call‚Äôd <i>Aves Memnoni√¶</i>, arose from the same funeral pile, which
    immediately divided into two companies, and fought till they destroy‚Äôd
    each other. And that a like flight of the same birds came on the same
    day every year from <i>Ethiopia</i>, went thrice round his monument,
    and then divided and fought in honour of their ancestor.</p>

  <p>What can we understand by this, but an assembly of his people and
    descendants to celebrate his anniversary, as was the custom of
    antiquity toward great men. The story is entirely of a piece with that
    told of <i>Cadmus</i>, and must be interpreted in the same way.</p>

  <p>In this sense we are treating of, are we to understand authors when
    they tell us, that <i>Cadmus</i> built a temple to <i>Neptune</i> in
    the island of <i>Rhodes</i>. This was not a cover‚Äôd temple with elegant
    pillars, nor an idolatrous one, which were matters of after-times; but
    one of our alate temples. <i>Phut</i> had built a <i>Dracontium</i>
    there before.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

  <p><i>Antoninus Liberalis</i> XII. speaks of the lake <i>Canopus</i>,
    which I suppose had its name from a <i>Cneph</i> or alate temple near
    it, built by a hero, <i>Cygnus</i>, son of <i>Phut</i>, ‚Äúwho, the fable
    says, was turn‚Äôd into a bird there,‚Äù and <i>Phylius</i> his sepulchral
    monument was by it.</p>

  <p>In this sense, <i>Strabo</i> II. speaks of <i>Hercules</i> being
    call‚Äôd <i>Canopeus</i>, from building such a temple. And we may now
    understand that hitherto abstruse <i>Egyptian</i> antiquity called
    <i>Canopus</i>, a vase which they us‚Äôd for preserving of water in their
    temples and in their families, with a cover to it. In order to insure
    the blessing of heaven to this most necessary element, they frequently
    consign‚Äôd it with the sacred prophylactic character of the <i>Kneph</i>
    or <i>circulus alatus</i>, which is the <i>greek Neptune</i>, the
    <i>dominator aquarum</i>. Many of these vases are still remaining in
    the cabinets of antiquarians. Such a one pictur‚Äôd in <i>Kircher</i>.</p>

  <p>And, by the by, I may mention that some of these vases are adorn‚Äôd with
    a <i>scarabeus</i> with expanded wings, and this is entirely of the
    same meaning as the alate circle. But this is not a place to discourse
    larger on these matters.</p>

  <p>I suspect <i>Geneva</i> and <i>Geneffa</i> have their names from such
    temples. As <i>Gnaphalus</i> a bird mention‚Äôd by <i>Aristotle</i>.
    <i>Simias</i> the <i>Rhodian</i> celebrates our <i>Cneph</i>, in
    his poem compos‚Äôd in the form of wings: as the author of motion
    and creation: hence the word <i>Nebula</i>, <span lang="el">ŒΩŒµœÜŒ≠ŒªŒ∑</span> and perhaps
    <i>Nebulo</i>.</p>

  <p>In the year 1725, the next year after I found out this <i>Humber</i>
    temple, and the last year of my travels, I found another of these alate
    temples, on <i>Navestock-common</i> in <i>Essex</i>, which seems to be
    of a later date than the other, and when perhaps the original doctrine
    concerning these theological speculations was somewhat forgotten;
    Because this temple is situate on a dry common, not near water; but the
    figure is the very same.</p>

  <p>What is exceedingly remarkable as to this noble antiquity on
    <i>Navestock-common</i>, is, that the name should remain to this time,
    and which confirms all that we said before concerning them, as to
    their name and meaning: for <i>Navestock</i> must have been so call‚Äôd
    from some old and remarkable tree, probably an oak, upon or by the
    <span class="gespertt1">CNEPH</span>, or winged temple; <i>Navestock</i>. Our <i>English</i> word
    <i>Knave</i>, which had no ill meaning at first, signifies the same
    thing, <i>alatus</i>, <i>impiger</i>; the latin word <i>Gnavus</i> the
    very same: and <i>Knap</i> a <i>Teutonick</i> word the like: all from
    the hebrew original.</p>

  <p>I doubt not, but there are more such temples in the <i>Britannick</i>
    isles, called <i>Knaves-castles</i> or the like. One I remember to have
    seen, on a great heathy common, by the <i>Roman Watling-street</i>
    in <i>Staffordshire</i>. And Mr. <i>Toland</i> takes notice of a
    winged temple of our Druids in the <i>Hebrid</i> or <i>Hyperborean</i>
    islands, <i>Shetland</i>. <i>Abaris</i> a Druid of this country,
    fir‚Äôd with a desire of knowledge, travell‚Äôd into <i>Greece</i>
    where philosophy flourish‚Äôd; after that to <i>Pythagoras</i> in
    <i>Italy</i>, and became his favourite disciple. <i>Pythagoras</i>
    imparted to him his best notions in philosophy, which perhaps, in the
    enigmatick way of those times, they call the shewing to him his golden
    thigh. <i>Abaris</i> on the other hand, presented to <i>Pythagoras</i>
    <i>Apollo</i>‚Äôs arrow, which he brought out of his own country, where it
    had been deposited in a winged temple. They tell you further, that
    <i>Abaris</i> rode on this arrow in the air to <i>Greece</i>. This
    undoubtedly would proceed from the notion they entertain‚Äôd of the
    Druids practising magick.</p>

  <p>I cannot help thinking, after what I have said in <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    concerning the magnetick needle, that this arrow of <i>Apollo</i>‚Äôs
    which <i>Abaris</i> made use of in his journey from <i>Shetland</i>
    to <i>Greece</i>, was an instrument of this sort,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> which the
    <i>Hyperborean</i> sage gave to <i>Pythagoras</i>. And the Druids
    possessing such a secret as this, would reciprocally create, and favour
    that notion of their practising magick. Calling it <i>Apollo</i>‚Äôs
    arrow seems to throw the possession of it up to <i>Phut</i> the most
    famous navigator, we before treated of: nay it seems that we may trace
    it still higher, even to <i>Noah</i> himself. <i>Sanchoniathon</i>
    the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> writer tells us, among other remarkable things
    concerning <i>Ouranus</i>, who is certainly <i>Noah</i>, ‚Äúthat he
    devised <i>B√¶tulia</i>, or contriv‚Äôd stones that mov‚Äôd as having life.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Besides the interpretation, we may very naturally affix to this
    account, of anointed stones or main ambres: we may well judge that
    the knowledge of the magnet is here understood; which at first they
    placed in a little boat, in a vessel of water, and then it would move
    itself, ‚Äôtill directed to the quarters of the heavens. <i>Atheneus
    Deipnosoph.</i> affirms, that <i>Hercules</i> borrow‚Äôd his golden cup
    wherewith he sail‚Äôd over the ocean, of <i>Nereus</i>. <i>Nereus</i>
    is <i>Japhet</i> eldest son of <i>Noah</i>, and the golden cup was a
    compass box in all probability.</p>

  <p>Among the ancient constellations pictur‚Äôd on the celestial globe, is an
    arrow; said by <i>Eratosthenes</i> the most ancient writer we have on
    the <i>Catasterisms</i>, (as called,) to be the arrow of <i>Apollo</i>,
    which was laid up in the winged temple among the <i>Hyperboreans</i>.
    <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> from <i>Hecateus</i> and other older writers,
    shews, the <i>Hyperborean</i> island was in the ocean, and beyond
    <i>Gaul</i>, to the north, under the bear; where the people liv‚Äôd
    a most simple and happy life. <i>Orpheus</i> places them near the
    <i>Cronian</i> sea; a word purely <i>Irish</i>, as Mr. <i>Toland</i>
    shews, <i>Croin</i> signifying frozen. He shews further and that very
    largely, that the <i>Hebrid</i> islands, <i>Skie</i>, <i>Lewis</i>,
    <i>Harries</i>, <i>Shetland</i>, are the true <i>Hyperborean</i>
    islands of the ancients. Among them therefore was the winged temple;
    whether made of mounds of earth, like those two on the <i>Humber</i>,
    and on <i>Navestock-common</i>; or made of stones like other Druid
    temples.</p>

  <p>There are other Druid temples in those islands, made of stones, I shall
    give a print of one, in my next volume. Further there is a famous one
    in <i>Cornwall</i> call‚Äôd vulgarly the <i>Hurlers</i>, which I take to
    have been one of our alate temples, made of stones set upright.</p>

  <p>The learned <i>Bayer</i> in his fine designs of the celestial
    constellations, represents the arrow of <i>Apollo</i> beforemention‚Äôd,
    as a magnetick needle; and he took his designs chiefly from a very
    ancient book of drawings. I observe likewise that the isle of
    <i>Skie</i>, in the language of the natives, is call‚Äôd <i>Scianach</i>,
    which signifies winged. And in that probably, was the winged temple we
    speak of; which gave name to the isle.</p>

  <p>We mention‚Äôd before that <i>Phut</i> married <i>Rhode</i>, whence the
    isle of <i>Rhodes</i> had its name. <i>Rod</i> in the <i>Psalms</i>
    and the <i>Prophets</i> signifies a snake. Nay <i>Pliny</i> in vii.
    and 56, of his natural history asserts, that <i>Rhodes</i> was
    originally call‚Äôd <i>Ophiusa</i>, a word equivalent. Most likely they
    built a serpentine temple there, which gave the name. So the isle
    of <i>Tenos</i>, which <i>Bochart</i> shews, means a serpent in the
    oriental language, was call‚Äôd <i>Hydrusa</i> and <i>Ophiusa</i>. The
    isle of <i>Cyprus</i> was call‚Äôd <i>Ophiodia</i> by <i>Nic≈ìnetus</i>.
    So <i>Hydra</i> an isle just before <i>Carthage</i>, which was first
    built by <i>Cadmus</i>. <i>Ophiades insul√¶</i> on the <i>Arabian</i>
    coast of the <i>Red-sea</i>. <i>Pausanias</i> mentions a place
    called <i>Opheos Cephale</i>, the serpent‚Äôs head; the same as our
    <i>Hakpen</i> on <i>Overton-hill</i> in <i>Abury</i>.</p>

  <p>In the isle of <i>Chios</i> is a famous mountain higher than the
    rest, called <i>Pelineus</i>, which had undoubtedly one of our great
    <i>Dracontian</i> temples.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
    The learned <i>Bochart</i> I. 9. shews its
    name signifies the prodigious serpent: a story of the sort is annex‚Äôd
    to it. Nay this famous temple gave name to the whole island, for he
    shews that ‚Äôtis a <i>Syrian</i> word <span lang="he">◊ó◊ï◊ô◊ê</span> <i>Chivia</i> a serpent,
    so that <i>Chios</i> isle is the serpent‚Äôs isle: the word is the
    same as <i>Hivite</i>: probably <i>Cadmus</i> or some of his people
    built it. <i>Hesychius</i> and <i>Phavorinus</i> mentions <i>Jupiter
    Pelineus</i>, the name of the deity worshiped.</p>

  <p><i>Virgil</i> in <i>√Üneid</i> II. describes the two serpents that
    destroy‚Äôd <i>Laocoon</i> coming from the isle of <i>Tenedos</i>.</p>

  <p>I described the barrows about <i>Humbers</i> castle, to be like beds.
    They are all long barrows, of very different lengths, higher at the
    head than the feet, (if we may so express it) and with a cavity the
    whole length of them, drawn off at the feet, to the turf: So that
    they represent the impression of a person that has lain on a very
    soft, downy couch. One which I dug into near the temple was 60 cubits
    long: the other two near it 40 each, <a href="#tab_XXXIX">plate xxxix</a>. The sight of them
    necessarily intruded into my mind, the <span lang="el">ŒµœÖŒΩŒ∑</span> or couch of <i>Typhon</i>
    or <i>Phut</i>, which <i>Homer</i> says, was in <i>Arimis</i>. ‚ÄôTis
    natural for us to imagine, he means exactly such a <i>tumulus</i> of
    the hero, as these we are speaking of.</p>

  <p><i>Phut</i> was a great arch druid or patriarchal high-priest, as
    being the head of his family. And according to my notion of the
    matter, these long barrows all belong to some of the higher order of
    the Druids. <i>Eustathius</i> interprets <i>Homer</i>‚Äôs word by that
    of <span lang="el">œÑŒ±œÜŒøœÇ</span>, tomb. <i>Stephanus</i> the scholiast on <i>Hesiod</i>‚Äôs
    <i>Theogon</i>, makes <i>Arima</i> a mountain in <i>Cilicia</i>
    or <i>Lydia</i>, where is <i>Tiphon</i>‚Äôs <span lang="el">Œ∫ŒøŒπœÑŒ∑</span>. <i>V. Oppian.
    Alexand.</i> ver. 599. <i>Lucan</i> ver. 191. <i>Apollon.</i> II.
    <i>Strabo</i> XVI. <i>Mela</i> I. 13. <i>Pausanias in Atticis</i> tells
    us of <i>Hippolita</i> the <i>Amazons‚Äô tumulus</i>, that ‚Äôtwas made in
    shape of an <i>Amazonian pelta</i> or shield; perhaps somewhat like our
    <i>tumulus</i>.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the idolatrous times, they likewise consecrated
    <i>Hermes</i> the <i>Egyptian</i> into <i>Mercury</i>, but the
    <i>Egyptians</i> took <i>Mercury</i> in a different light from the
    <i>Canaanites</i>: they made him the god of divine wisdom, the
    <i>Canaanites</i> who were immers‚Äôd in trade and traffick, made him
    the god of profit and gain; and that in the person of their ancestor
    <i>Canaan</i>. Nevertheless they knew the holy spirit prior to
    idolatry: for many think that <i>Mercury</i> was no mortal man, S.
    <i>Augustin</i>, <i>C. D.</i> viii. 26. and <i>Orpheus</i> in his hymn
    to him, pronounces him to be of the race of <i>Dionysus</i>, by whom
    <i>Jehovah</i> is understood.</p>

  <p>I suppose <i>Canaan</i> when he died, had an alate temple built about
    his place of sepulture, which in after times occasion‚Äôd posterity to
    deify him under the name of <i>Mercury</i>. Again I suppose the like
    done over the <i>tumulus</i> of the patriarch <span class="gespertt1">TARSIS</span>; which gave a
    handle in idolatrous times, to consecrate him into the <i>Neptune</i>
    of the heathen; who in effect is the same as <i>Mercury</i>, saving
    that being done by people of a different genius and disposition, they
    divided one god into two.</p>

  <p>Thus we have sail‚Äôd thro‚Äô a wide ocean of antiquities, and that not
    without a compass. We set old things transmitted to us in writing, in
    parallelism with these we may now see at home, in such a manner, as I
    think evidently shews them to be the same.</p>

  <p>I shall conclude, with 1. what we may very well imagine to have been
    the ratiocination of the Druids among one another, in their theological
    contemplations, concerning this last kind of their works, these winged
    temples. Of such sort would be their speculations thereon, in their
    serious scrutiny into the nature of the deity.</p>

  <p>We observ‚Äôd, the Druids in their theological studies must, with the
    other eastern sages, find out two ways of the supreme being exerting
    his almighty power, multiplying himself, as the <i>Zoroastrians</i>,
    the <i>Pythagoreans</i> and the <i>Platonists</i> call it, or divine
    geniture: and creation. The first necessary, therefore done before
    time; the second arbitrary, therefore done in time. Nevertheless this
    second was fit and proper to be done, therefore necessarily to be
    perform‚Äôd. For whatever becomes the allperfect being, we may pronounce
    necessary with him.</p>

  <p>The Druids would advance still further in their contemplations this
    way, and conclude, that it became the supreme, and was therefore
    necessary, for him to exert his power in all possible ways and modes of
    acting; that he was not content in producing a single divine person or
    emanation from himself, from the infinite fund of his own fecundity;
    that he was pleas‚Äôd to proceed to that other mode of acting, which we
    call divine procession; or a third divine person to proceed from the
    first and second. This person the ancients had knowledge of, and styled
    him <i>anima mundi</i>, ‚Äúthat spirit of the <span class="gespertt1">LORD</span> which filleth the
    world,‚Äù <i>Wisdom</i> i. 7. and made him a distinct person from God, or
    the supreme: but, more immediately, he was the author of life to all
    living things. And this he disseminated throughout the whole macrocosm.
    I need only quote <i>Virgil</i>, for many more, in his fine poem,
    <i>Georg.</i> IV.</p>

  <p>This divine mind, or <i>anima mundi</i>, <a href="#tab_XL">the ancients pictur‚Äôd</a> out by
    the circle and wings, meaning the holy spirit in symbolical language,
    or the spirit proceeding from the fountain of divinity. And we see it
    innumerable times on <i>Egyptian</i>, and other ancient monuments.
    <i>Plutarch</i>, in his <i>platonic questions</i>, asks, ‚ÄúWhy should
    <i>Plato</i> in his <i>Ph√¶dro</i> say, the nature of a wing, which
    mounts heavy things upward, is chiefly participant of those that are
    about the body of the deity?‚Äù</p>

  <p>But thus the Druids would reason. There are three modes of divine
    origin and existence, quite different from creation: they are these:
    the self-existent, unoriginated first cause; divine generation; and
    divine procession: all equal in nature, self-origination excepted, and
    equally necessarily existent. When the supreme produces his likeness,
    it must be divine filiation; or the son of God is produc‚Äôd. Divine
    procession must be from them two: but it cannot possibly be filiation:
    for besides that, in these acts of the divinity, we must separate all
    ideas like that of human production, it would be absurd to call this
    generation; because, as it is done prior to all notion of time, or
    eternity itself; it is making the son to be son and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> father in the same
    act. Therefore there remains no other word for this, than procession
    from the father and son.</p>

  <p>Whether these abstract and metaphysical notions would occur to a mind
    wholly unacquainted with any doctrine of this sort, may be matter
    of doubt; but when propos‚Äôd to a serious and contemplative genius,
    they would be embraced and improved, as agreeable to reason; and as
    an advance towards the most sublime and most useful knowledge of all
    others, that of the nature of the deity.</p>

  <p>2. The very learned <i>Schedius</i>, in his treatise <i>de mor.
    germ.</i> XXIV. speaking of the Druids, confirms exceedingly all that
    we have said on this head. He writes, ‚Äúthat they seek studiously
    for an oak-tree, large and handsome, growing up with two principal
    arms, in form of a cross, beside the main stem upright. If the two
    horizontal arms are not sufficiently adapted to the figure, they fasten
    a cross-beam to it. This tree they consecrate in this manner. Upon the
    right branch they cut in the bark, in fair characters, the word <span class="gespertt1">HESUS</span>:
    upon the middle or upright stem, the word <span class="gespertt1">TARAMIS</span>: upon the left branch
    <span class="gespertt1">BELENUS</span>: over this, above the going off of the arms, they cut the name
    of God, <span class="gespertt1">THAU</span>: under all the same repeated, <span class="gespertt1">THAU</span>.‚Äù</p>

  <p>We cannot possibly understand otherwise, than that by this they
    intended to show the unity in the divine nature; for every word
    signifies God emphatically, and in their general acceptation,
    <i>Thau</i> especially. The other three words have each particularly a
    more restrained sense, regarding the oeconomy of the deity or godhead.
    And this is <i>Schedius</i> his opinion.</p>

  <p>This tree, so inscribed, they make their <i>kebla</i> in the grove,
    cathedral, or summer-church, toward which they direct their faces in
    the offices of religion, as to the ambre stone or the cove in the above
    described temples of <i>Abury</i>. Like as the Christians to any symbol
    or picture over the altar. And hence the writers got a notion of their
    worshipping trees; and of these names belonging to so many gods: which
    serves the poets to descant upon. But if we examine them to their
    origin, they are easily to be reduc‚Äôd to orthodoxy.</p>

  <p>The word <i>Hesus</i> means the supreme God in the <i>celtic</i>
    language, as <span class="gespertt1">ESAR</span> among the <i>Hetruscans</i>. <i>Sueton. in Aug.</i> It was
    pronounced <i>Eisar</i>, as the <i>germans</i> pronounce <i>C√¶sar</i>,
    <i>Keisar</i>. It comes from the <i>hebrew</i> <span lang="he">◊î</span> <i>Ei</i>, and <span lang="he">◊°◊®</span>
    <i>Lord</i>, <span lang="he">◊©◊®</span> <i>Prince</i>. <span lang="he">◊î</span> is emphatically the name of the
    divinity, as <span lang="he">◊î◊©◊ù</span> œÑŒø <span lang="el">ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ±</span>, the <span class="gespertt1">NAME</span> <i>Jehovah</i>, <i>Levit.</i>
    xxiv. 11. 16. Hence <span lang="he">◊î</span> or <span class="gespertt1">EI</span>, inscribed over the door of the temple
    at <i>Delphos</i>, of which <i>Plutarch</i> has wrote. It was the
    way of the <i>babylonish</i> monarchs to assume divine names, as
    <i>Esar-adon</i>, signifying no less than God the Lord. <i>Esi</i>
    is God, says <i>Hesychius</i>. In the <i>arabic</i> it signifies the
    <i>Creator</i>, says <i>Dickenson delph. ph≈ìnic.</i> But these authors
    do not go to the bottom, for it comes from <span class="gespertt1">AS</span> or <span class="gespertt1">AT</span>, signifying God
    the father. <span lang="el">·ºåœÑŒ±</span> or <span lang="el">·ºåœÑœÑŒ±</span>, with the <i>Greeks</i> is <i>pater</i>.
    The <i>Armenians</i> call it <span lang="el">ŒëŒ¥œÇ</span>, the <i>Egyptians</i> <span lang="el">·Ω®œÑ</span>, those of
    <i>Sarmatia</i> and <i>Slavonia</i> <span lang="el">ŒüœÇ</span>: says the learned <i>Baxter</i>,
    <i>v. Ascania</i>, <i>gloss. ant. Rom.</i> where he has much of ancient
    learning upon it. This is the <i>Atys</i> of the <i>Phrygians</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Belenus</i> is the <i>Baal</i> in scripture, us‚Äôd originally to be
    spoken of the true God <i>Jehovah</i>, ‚Äôtill adopted into idolatry.
    <i>Belus</i> of the <i>Assyrians</i>. If we examine the word to the
    bottom, it means God the son. <span lang="el">ŒíŒ∑Œª</span>, in the <i>babylonic</i> language is
    the <i>son</i>, <span lang="el">ŒíŒ∑ŒªœÑŒπœÇ</span> the <i>daughter</i>. He is the <i>Apollo</i> of
    the <i>Latins</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

  <p><i>Tharamis</i> is the same as <i>Tat</i>, <i>Thoth</i> of the
    <i>Egyptians</i>, <i>Thor</i> of the northern nations, call‚Äôd more
    particularly the <i>spirit: lord of the air</i>, from the wings
    being symbolical of him; and hence made the thunderer, from the
    <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> and <i>celtick Tarem</i>. He was sometimes call‚Äôd
    <i>Theutates</i>, the <i>Mercury</i> of the <i>Latins</i>, who was
    particularly worshipped by the <i>Germans</i>, says <i>Tacitus de
    mor. germ.</i> <i>C√¶sar</i> the same, VI. <i>bell. gall.</i> Hence the
    <i>Greeks</i> dress‚Äôd their <i>Mercury</i> with a winged cap, and
    winged heels, which was no other than the <i>circulus alatus</i> we
    have been speaking of. He bears a staff in his hand, with a globe on
    the end of it with wings and snakes. The <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> call‚Äôd him
    <i>Taautus</i>. <i>Sanchoniathon</i>, <i>Varro</i> IV. <i>de ling. lat.</i></p>

  <p>So in the temple of <i>Belus</i> or the <i>sun</i>, at <i>Edessa</i>
    in <i>Mesopotamia</i>, in idolatrous times, by his statue was
    another of <i>Ezizus</i>, who is our <i>Hesus</i>, and another of
    <i>Mercury</i>, whom they call <i>Monimus</i>. <i>Julian</i>, in his
    <i>hymn to the sun</i>, mentions the same. And so generally the true
    theology communicated to mankind from the beginning, was perverted into
    polytheism and idolatry.</p>

  <p>3. So by the tree came death, by the tree came life, which the Druids
    seem to have had some knowledge of. <i>Ruffinus</i> II. 29. affirms
    the cross among the <i>Egyptians</i> was an hieroglyphic importing the
    life that is to come. <i>Sozomen</i> the same, <i>hist. eccl.</i> VII.
    15. and <i>Suidas</i>. <i>Isidore</i> tells, ‚Äúit was the method of the
    muster-masters in the <i>roman</i> army, in giving in the lists of the
    soldiers, to mark with a cross the name of the man that was alive; with
    a Œò him that was dead.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The ancient inhabitants of <i>America</i> honour‚Äôd the form of the
    cross. So the conjurers in <i>Lapland</i> use it. Which intimate this
    hieroglyphic to be most ancient, probably antediluvian.</p>

  <p>But concerning the knowledge of the cross which the Druids had, and
    of their religion more at large, I shall discourse fully in the next
    volume, which will conclude what I have to say concerning them and
    their works.</p>

  <p>4. From what has been delivered in the speculative part of this
    treatise, the springs of idolatry appear sufficiently. For the race of
    heroes that built these patriarchal temples in the eastern part of the
    world especially, and propagated true religion, were some ages after
    deify‚Äôd by their idolatrous posterity; and had names of consecration
    taken from the divine attributes, and the just notions delivered to
    them concerning the nature of the deity.</p>

  <p>5. If then we reflect on the foregoing description of the work of
    <i>Abury</i>, whether we consider the figure it is built upon, the
    antiquity or the grandeur of it, we must needs admire it, as deservedly
    to be rank‚Äôd among the greatest wonders on the face of the earth. The
    ancients indeed did make huge temples of immense pillars in colonnades,
    like a small forest; or vast concaves of cupolas to represent the
    heavens; they made gigantick colosses to figure out their gods; but to
    our <i>British</i> Druids was reserv‚Äôd the honour of a more extensive
    idea, and of executing it. They have made plains and hills, valleys,
    springs and rivers contribute to form a temple of three miles in
    length. They have stamp‚Äôd a whole country with the impress of this
    sacred character, and that of the most permanent nature. The golden
    temple of <i>Solomon</i> is vanish‚Äôd, the proud structure of the
    <i>Babylonian Belus</i>, the temple of <i>Diana</i> at <i>Ephesus</i>,
    that of <i>Vulcan</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, that of the <i>Capitoline
      Jupiter</i> are perish‚Äôd and obliterated, whilst <i>Abury</i>, I
    dare say, older than any of them, within a very few years ago, in
    the beginning of this century, was intire; and even now, there are
    sufficient traces left, whereby to learn a perfect notion of the whole.
    Since I frequented the place, I fear it has suffer‚Äôd: but at that time,
    there was scarce a single stone in the original
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> ground-plot wanting,
    but I could trace it to the person then living who demolish‚Äôd it, and
    to what use and where.</p>

  <p>This I verily believe to have been a truly patriarchal temple, as the
    rest likewise, which we have here described; and where the worship of
    the true God was perform‚Äôd. And I conclude with what <i>Epiphanius</i>
    writes, speaking of the old religion from the beginning of the world.
    <i>Non erat judaismus aut secta qu√¶piam alia: sed ut ita dicam, ea qu√¶
    nunc in pr√¶senti sancta Dei catholica ecclesia obtinet, fides erat; qu√¶
    cum ab initio extiterit, postea rursum est manifestata.</i> He affirms
    <i>Adam</i> and all the patriarchs from him to <i>Abraham</i>, were no
    other than christians; and this is the doctrine of the apostle of the
    <i>Gentiles</i>, 1 <i>Cor.</i> ix. 21.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
